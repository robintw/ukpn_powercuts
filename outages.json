        "Comment": "Good morning, this is a message from Alicia at UK Power Networks regarding the planned power cut that is scheduled for today the 8th December 2025 in the NR16 postcode area. Our contractors have advised us that there is going to be a delay in some customers being switched off due to some safety checks that need to be completed before the main power can be switched off. We now estimate to switch off the power in stages by approximately 10:30 for those customers who are still waiting to be switched off. Our reference number for this work is INCD-23775-O. We would like to apologise for any inconvenience this may cause you. If you have any questions or you have moved from the NR16 postcode area, then please give us a call on 105. Thank you",

As a result, further supplies are now back on.\n\nTo allow time for the final generator to be connected, we're now estimating to have the last properties restored between 11:00 and 12:00. I know another delay is frustrating; our engineers always try to give us the best estimate that they can but due to the safety elements of working with live electricity, sometimes they have to adjust their repairs at short notice.\n\n",

Our engineers have diverted power around overhead cable fault to get the majority of customers back on. However, due to the location and complexity of the issue, we have also used temporary generators to restore power to the last of the affected properties. This will provide power until our engineers plan in and safely complete the full repair, which may take a few days.\n\nWe know that a power cut can be difficult, and I'm sorry for the length of the time you were without your electricity. If your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n",

Thanks for bearing with us during the power cut, I know the lights being off is a worry.\n\nOur staff have advised that they have connected the first of the temporary generators, and are now in the process of connecting the second one. As a result, further supplies are now back on.\n\nTo allow time for the final generator to be connected, we're now estimating to have the last properties restored between 11:00 and 12:00. I know another delay is frustrating; our engineers always try to give us the best estimate that they can but due to the safety elements of working with live electricity, sometimes they have to adjust their repairs at short notice.\n\n",

The issue was caused by an unexpected underground cable fault, which our engineers have excavated down to and diverted power around.\n\nWe know that a power cut can be difficult, and I'm sorry for the length of the time you were without your electricity. Please rest assured that our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

For now we have restored your power as quickly as we can.\n\nIf your power isn't on or you would like to talk to us, call us for free on 08003163105.

They may also walk our cabling route throughout the area to check for any visible problems, check smaller electrical sites in the area, or apply specialist equipment which may restore power temporarily to help them with their testing.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nWe'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",

Thanks for your patience today, our field staff and control room engineers are working to get your power back on as quickly as they can.\n\nOur records show that some properties affected by today's power cut may have had other unexpected interruptions recently. If you have, we're sorry for further disruption. All power cuts are fully investigated by our engineers but can sometimes happen multiple times before we can safely find the issue and fix it.\n\nWe know that not everyone affected by today's power cut will have had other power cuts recently, but we want you to know that if you have, our customer services team will try to update as many customers as possible about our investigations.",
