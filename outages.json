        "Comment": "Sent by David at 06:08 - Hi David here from the messaging team.  I'm pleased to confirm that all power in the Woodfield Gardens area should be back on. The issue was caused by an unexpected faulty piece of electrical equipment, which our engineers have replaced.\n\nWe know that a power cut can be difficult, and I'm sorry for the length of the time you were without your electricity. Please rest assured that our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

They may also walk our cabling route throughout the area to check for any visible problems, check smaller electrical sites in the area, or apply specialist equipment which may restore power temporarily to help them with their testing.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nWe'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",

The issue was caused by an unexpected fault on the underground electrical network, which our engineers have repaired. \n\nWe know that a power cut can be difficult, and I'm sorry for the length of the time you were without your electricity.

Our team of cable jointers have now identified the suspected section of faulted underground cabling using their specialist equipment.\n\nOur digging team will now begin excavations, and this can take some time depending on the surface material, and how much space is needed to allow our engineers to assess the fault and make their repairs safely. \n\nOur estimated time frame of 14:30-15:30 doesn't need to change currently. We'll continue to keep you updated, but our team are always here if you have any questions.",

I know having power cuts as often as this must be very disruptive, and our staff are doing everything they can to get this resolved.\n\nThey are still testing our network in the area, and depending on the local infrastructure this can take some time. However, once they update us we'll know if our estimated time frame needs to change and why, and I'll let you know as soon as we hear.\n\nIn the meantime, if we can offer any support or advice, our team are always available to talk on 105.\n\nSent by Talie at 08:25.",

For now we have restored your power as quickly as we can.\n\nIf your power isn't on or you would like to talk to us, call us for free on 08003163105. We know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",

        "Comment": "Sent by Talie at 11:22 - Our engineers are on their way. We believe the issue is an underground cable fault that initially interrupted power to 1465 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 418 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 12:30-13:30, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

They may also walk our cabling route throughout the area to check for any visible problems, check smaller electrical sites in the area, or apply specialist equipment which may restore power temporarily to help them with their testing.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nWe'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",

This leaves 45 properties affected by the overhead fault. \n\nOur staff are checking our equipment throughout the area to pinpoint the issue on our network. In addition to this, they are liaising closely with our control room to find safe and reliable ways to divert power around any problems and get everyone restored. \n\nYou may be worried about the food in your fridge and freezer. Food should keep for up to 6 hours in the fridge, and between 15-24 hours in the freezer if you can avoid opening them. \n\nIf your power is back on and you wish to stop receiving texts, just follow this link https://bit.ly/348KOZ3 to unsubscribe.",

By doing this, we've managed to restore power to 858 customers. There are now 98 properties still affected and using an average time frame we're estimating all power will be on between 20:00 and 21:00, but this may change later depending on what our staff find.\n\nWe'll keep sending SMS updates until everybody is restored.

We have already sent staff to the area, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting the electricity around the faulty section. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will locate and repair the issue, which will take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",
