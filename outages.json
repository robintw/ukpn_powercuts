It may help to locate a torch and anything else you may need so you can have it to hand just in case.\n\nIf you have any concerns please do not hesitate to contact our team, but we will work to fix the problem as quickly and safely as possible.

        "Comment": "We're sorry your power has gone off again.\n\nWe believe there may be an underlying issue causing the recent power cuts, but due to the nature of the electricity network, the heat created by a developing fault can cause a break in a cable to reseal itself. This can make it difficult to locate, so while our engineers are testing our equipment thoroughly to pinpoint the issue, this kind of problem may interrupt power multiple times before it's possible for us to fix.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nI'll keep you updated. Sent by Simon at 08:19",

        "Comment": "Our engineers have now arrived on site in the Thornton Road area.\n\nAs any issues that currently exist on our network have affected our equipment at the substation, engineers will start their testing there. They will then check our network equipment throughout the area to try and identify any problems, before trying to restore power.\n\nOur estimated time frame of 11:00-12:00 hasn't changed, but if this is not successful it's possible that a cable repair may be needed. This can involve ground excavations, traffic management equipment or specialist teams. As soon as our staff can safely update us, we'll give you the latest news. Sent by Simon at 08:07.",

Our engineers have now investigated the low hanging overhead cables, and have deemed it safe to restore power back to all 1081 properties in the King's Lynn PE32 area.\n\nWe're very sorry we had to turn your power off unexpectedly, and with so little warning. We usually provide much more notice if we can, but in a situation like this our first priority is the safety of the public and our staff.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. If your power is still off or if you have any questions, call our team on 08003163105.",

We've had an update from our staff that there are now 5 properties still affected by the emergency isolation, as they have managed to safely divert some power, getting the lights back on for 826 of our customers.\n\nWe'll keep sending text updates to everyone until all the power to your area is on.

This is why a wide area has lost electricity.\n\nOnce further specialist field staff have assessed the situation, we'll start diverting power back to affected homes as soon as they advise us it's safe. You may notice your lights going on and off as we work to get as much power restored as we can.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",

Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 15:30-16:30, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

        "Comment": "What will happen next?\n\nThis outage is affecting multiple areas, so locations we mention may be further away than you'd expect. We have already sent staff to the area, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting the electricity around the faulty section. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will locate and repair the issue, which will take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",

        "Comment": "Sent by Roland at 12:50 - Our engineers are on their way. We believe the issue is a fault on our overhead cables that initially interrupted power to 703 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 291 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 14:00 and 15:00 but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

I appreciate losing power multiple times on the same day is frustrating, so thanks for bearing with us while we work to fix these issues.\n\nAt the moment, our estimated time frame for power is between 16:30 and 17:30. However, as before there is a chance this could change depending on what our staff discover when they arrive.\n\nI'll be on hand to advise updates until your power is back up and running, but you can always reach our team on 105 if you need to speak to us.",
