There are now only 2 properties without power, who we'll speak to directly. If you're without power and haven't been contacted, then we'll need to hear from you. Please call us on 08003163105 (free from landlines and mobiles).\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the unexpected outage.

We didn't know this was going to happen, so time frames we provide throughout are estimated and are subject to change.\n\nOur estimated time to have power back on is currently between 01:00 and 02:00, but after we arrive and assess the situation this may change. The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",

I just wanted to let you know. \n\nOur engineers have let us know that they have run into complications on site in the Calcott Walk area with the ongoing repairs to the faulty underground electrical equipment. This is proving much more complex the we have thought and is now hindering our progress.. To give them time to do this safely, the estimated time frame to restore your power is now between 14:00 and 15:00.\n\nWe're sorry this is taking longer than expected, and we'll continue to keep you up to date, but if any change to this time comes in from our staff I'll let you know as soon as we hear.",

There are now only 3 properties without power, who we'll speak to directly. If you're without power and haven't been contacted, then we'll need to hear from you. Please call us on 08003163105 (free from landlines and mobiles).\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the unexpected outage.

This is because there are three separate power cables that supply your street and not all of these cables are affected by today's issue.\n\nWe will work to fix the problem as quickly and safely as possible. though if you have any concerns about this please do not hesitate to contact our Customer Services team any time.\n\n",

We believe the issue is an overhead network fault that initially interrupted power to 1734 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 264 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 10:30-11:30, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

The issue was due to an underground network fault, however engineers have managed to restore power from the substation nearby and will be investigating the root cause.\n\nIf there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the unexpected outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",
