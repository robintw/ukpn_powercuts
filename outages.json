There are now only 2 properties without power, who we'll speak to directly. If you're without power and haven't been contacted, then we'll need to hear from you. Please call us on 08003163105 (free from landlines and mobiles).\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the unexpected outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",

        "Comment": "Sent by Lisa at 09:50 - Hello again. Thanks for bearing with us during the power cut, I know the lights being off is a worry.\n\nOur staff have advised that the parked car has now been moved which means we can now progress with repairs. Due to the delay this has caused, they've advised a new time of 13:00 and 14:00 to have your power back on.\n\nI know another delay is frustrating; our engineers always try to give us the best estimate that they can but due to the safety elements of working with live electricity, sometimes they have to adjust their repairs at short notice.\n\nI'm sorry if this has caused you to change any plans you've made, but we'll be here to update you until the lights are safely back on.",

Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

They may also walk our cabling route throughout the area to check for any visible problems, check smaller electrical sites in the area, or apply specialist equipment which may restore power temporarily to help them with their testing.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice.

Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

        "Comment": "Sent by Aaron at 14:14 - We're very sorry we've had to switch off your electricity. Our engineers have turned off the power in the CT4 7/CT4 8/TN25 4 area in the interest of the public's health and safety. This is so they can investigate reports of an overhead cable that is on the ground.\n\nIf in the area, please take care and stay at least 10m away from the cable. \n\nUntil our engineers arrive on site and investigate, it's difficult to advise you a time frame. However, based on an average for this kind of issue, our estimated time to have you back on is between 17:00 and 18:00. \n\nWe'll keep you updated with our progress, but in the meantime our team are always here to talk on 105 if you have any questions or concerns.",

        "Comment": "What will happen next?\n\nWe have been alerted to a potentially dangerous situation involving overhead cables on the ground, so have responded as quickly as possible and asked our control room to turn power off to the area using our high voltage network. This is why a wide area has lost electricity.\n\nOnce further specialist field staff have assessed the situation, we'll start diverting power back to affected homes as soon as they advise us it's safe. You may notice your lights going on and off as we work to get as much power restored as we can.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",

        "Comment": "Sent by Lee at 21:25 - We believe our engineers have been able to restore power to all 1259 customers in the TN28 8, TN29 9 area, by diverting power around an overhead cable fault. This means we have been able to restore power sooner than we anticipated, we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.",

The issue was caused by an unexpected fault on our overhead cables, which our engineers have diverted power around the fault.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured that our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",
