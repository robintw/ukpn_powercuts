This work is taking place near the B2095. A road closure will be in place from the 9th-11th of February 2026 to allow the works to be carried out safely.

We have now restored power to all but one property. We're sorry for any disruption this unexpected power cut caused.\n\nIf your power isn't back on, we'd still like to keep you updated. If we aren't currently in contact with you by phone or in person at your property, please call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage and how long you were off for. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",

Thanks for bearing with us during the power cut, I know the lights being off is a worry.\n\nOur staff have advised that repairs to the fault are progressing, however it's taking longer than expected. Due to this, they've advised a new time of 01:30-02:30 to have your power back on.\n\nI know another delay is frustrating; our engineers always try to give us the best estimate that they can but due to the safety elements of working with live electricity, sometimes they have to adjust their repairs at short notice.\n\nI'm sorry if this has caused you to change any plans you've made, but we'll be here to update you until the lights are safely back on.",

For now we have restored your power as quickly as we can.\n\nIf your power isn't on or you would like to talk to us, call us for free on 08003163105.

This will allow them to cut our cable, and using specialist equipment, test each side to help narrow down where the fault lies.\n\nDue to the extent of work still required we have had to change the estimated timeframe to between 17:30 and 18:30. We'll continue to keep you updated, but our team are always here on 08003163105 from any phone if you have any questions. Sent by David at 11:33.",
