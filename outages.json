        "Comment": "Good morning, this is a message from Harry at UK Power Networks regarding the planned power cut which is currently in progress today the 7th November 2025 in the ME9 postcode area. The power was switched off to enable our contractors to test a piece of equipment called a transformer near Grovehurst Avenue. Our contractors have advised us that the 44 affected properties will be restored early at approximately 10:15. This is due to the works progressing well and being completed ahead of schedule. Once these works are complete this will improve the reliability of the electricity network. Our reference number for this work is INCD-326683-U. I hope that the power coming on earlier is of benefit to you. We always aim to provide a 10/10 service, if you feel we have not delivered you a 10/10 service then please call us on 105.",

They will start running tests at our substation to see how the local network is operating.\n\nIt's quite common for power to be restored briefly and go off again; this is our engineers using testing equipment to energise different sections of our network - this helps to narrow down any possible issues.\n\nOur cabling network is often broken down by smaller sites, and our staff may also check these to test for any problems, and they may also walk the cabling route to see if there are any signs of malfunction that have appeared on the surface. Our time frame hasn't been adjusted, so for now I'll let you know more news as soon as our staff update us.\n\nSent by Roland at 15:50.",

        "Comment": "Sent by Joe at 14:42 - Engineers are on their way. At this point we think the issue is a fault with equipment in your local substation in the Market Square area. We didn't know this was going to happen, so time frames we provide throughout are estimated and are subject to change.\n\nOur estimated time to have power back on is currently between 17:30 and 18:30, but after we arrive and assess the situation this may change. The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",

We have an ongoing problem on the local electricity network which has been causing unplanned power cuts recently, and we've been made aware that power has gone off again.\n\nMy name is Joe, I work on the messaging team at UK Power Networks and I just wanted to inform you that we know about this. If your electricity is off again you can get live updates on today's power cut from my team at http://www.ukpowernetworks.co.uk/power-cut/incident?incidentid=[INCIDENTID].\n\nIf you need extra help or support, or just want to speak to us about anything, call us on 105.",

We didn't know this was going to happen, so time frames we provide throughout are estimated and are subject to change.\n\nOur estimated time to have power back on is currently between 15:30 and 16:30, but after we arrive and assess the situation this may change. The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",

Today's power cut was unexpected, so we were unable to provide you with prior notice to help you plan ahead. I am pleased to confirm that we managed to resolve this by diverting power to get your lights back on as soon as possible.\n\nJust so you know, we text customers when we are made aware of problems like this, so if you would like to be notified in the future you can do so here https://bit.ly/3zyHC6L.\n\nThis was a widespread problem on the overhead network and I personally apologise for any disruption this has caused to your day. If you have any questions or are still without power, please call us on 105.",

This means we have been able to restore power sooner than we anticipated, we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.",

In addition to this, they are liaising closely with our control room to find safe and reliable ways to divert power around any problems and get everyone restored.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them. We'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",

To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on.

By doing this, we've managed to restore power to 168 customers. There are now 42 properties still affected and using an average time frame we're estimating all power will be on between15:30 and 16:30, but this may change later depending on what our staff find.\n\nWe'll keep sending SMS updates until everybody is restored.
