Our estimated time to have your power back on is between 18:00 and 19:00, however, this may need to change later depending on how our works progress.\n\nIf you'd like more information about why we sometimes have to switch power off to work; here's a short video https://bit.ly/3cYez0V. We'll keep you updated with progress.",

We can't always restore everyone this way. That's why we're also sending staff to the area to check our equipment.\n\nEvery fault is different, so our time frames have to be estimated but currently we hope to have power back on between 19:00 and 20:00.

It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there.

This has identified cables and 6 poles that need replacing and upgrading. We will also be replacing stay wires and transferring service cables to the new poles. Doing this will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut in the future as we appreciate your area has been impacted with unplanned power cuts in the last 6 months. To complete the work safely, we need to turn your power off to upgrade the equipment. To ensure the power is off for the shortest possible time, our contractors may carry out preparation works prior to the power cut. This work is taking place in Cooks Drove. A road closure will be in place to allow the work to be carried out safely. Access to your property will always be provided.",

This can make it difficult to locate, so while our engineers are testing our equipment thoroughly to pinpoint the issue, this kind of problem may interrupt power multiple times before it's possible for us to fix.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nI'll keep you updated. Sent by Theo at 10:26",

        "Comment": "Sent by Roland at 14:43 - Our engineers have now restored power to all 536 customers in the BN5/BN44/ RH13 area, by removing a large tree from our overhead cables & repaired the damaged power lines. We know power may have been off for a long time; we're sorry for any disruption this unplanned power cut caused. \n\nWe know some properties in the area may have faced other recent interruptions, and we're sorry for the extra disruption. Every outage is fully investigated by our engineers, though power may be lost several times before we can safely find and fix the issue. Our customer services team will keep as many customers updated as possible during these investigations\n\nTo talk to us, or let us know that your power isn't restored, call us on 08003163105",

If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to speak to our team, but I'll let you know further news as it comes in from site. Sent by Talie at 13:56.",

Our engineers have advised that unfortunately there is going to be a delay in restoring your power. This is due to the earlier engineering difficulties experienced on site which have delayed the progression of the works. We now estimate to restore your power between approximately 12:30 and 13:30. Please note that this is an estimated time frame and that your power may come on sooner. Our reference number for this work is INCD-15850-I. We would like to apologise for any inconvenience this may cause you. If you have any questions or you have moved from the NR15 postcode area, then please give us a call on 105.",

Our engineers have now investigated the grounded cables, and have deemed it safe to restore power back to all 599 properties in the Dover CT15 area.\n\nWe're very sorry we had to turn your power off unexpectedly, and with so little warning. We usually provide much more notice if we can, but in a situation like this our first priority is the safety of the public and our staff.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. If your power is still off or if you have any questions, call our team on 08003163105.",

Our engineers have turned off the power in the Dover CT15 area in the interest of the public's health and safety. This is so they can investigate reports of an overhead cable that is on the ground.\n\nIf in the area, please take care and stay at least 10m away from the cable. \n\nUntil our engineers arrive on site and investigate, it's difficult to advise you a time frame. However, based on an average for this kind of issue, our estimated time to have you back on is between 18:00 and 19:00\n\nWe'll keep you updated with our progress, but in the meantime our team are always here to talk on 105 if you have any questions or concerns.",
