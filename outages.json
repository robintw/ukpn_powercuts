However, once they've assessed further we'll let you know if the time frame needs to change.\n\nFor more information about this type of fault; here's a short video https://bit.ly/2ScxQDZ - I'll keep you updated.",

We have already sent staff to the area, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting the electricity around the faulty section. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will locate and repair the issue, which will take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",

Today's power cut was an unexpected fault on our underground cables that affected several thousand properties, so I'm sorry that we weren't able to provide you with prior notice. I'm pleased to report our staff have resolved this by diverting power to get your lights back on as soon as possible.\n\nWe contact customers when we are made aware of problems like this, so if you would like to be notified in future let us know here https://bit.ly/3zyHC6L\n\nI personally apologise for the disruption this caused you. We aim to provide a 10/10 service in keeping you updated, so if you'd like to talk to us about anything or are still without power, please call us on 105.",

        "Comment": "What will happen next?\n\nThis outage is affecting multiple areas, so locations we mention may be further away than you'd expect. We have already sent staff to the area, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting the electricity around the faulty section. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will locate and repair the issue, which will take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",

The issue was caused by an unexpected fault with some of our network equipment, which our engineers have now replaced.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

The issue was caused by an unexpected fault with some of our network equipment, which our engineers have now replaced.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

The power was switched off to enable our contractors to replace and upgrade a piece of equipment called a transformer near Gutteridge Hall Lane. Our contractors have advised us that the 15 affected properties will be restored early between approximately 11:00 and 11:30. This is due to the works progressing well on site, meaning that the works can be completed ahead of schedule. Once these works are complete this will improve the reliability of the electricity network and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut. Our reference number for this work is INCD-23845-O. I hope that the power coming on earlier is of benefit to you. We always aim to provide a 10/10 service, if you feel we have not delivered you a 10/10 service then please call us on 105.",

        "Comment": "Good morning, this is a message from Harry at UK Power Networks regarding the planned power cut which is currently in progress today the 25th November 2025 in the CO16 postcode area. The power was switched off to enable our contractors to replace and upgrade a piece of equipment called a transformer near Gutteridge Hall Lane. Our contractors have advised us that the 15 affected properties will be restored early between approximately 11:00 and 11:30. This is due to the works progressing well on site, meaning that the works can be completed ahead of schedule. Once these works are complete this will improve the reliability of the electricity network and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut. Our reference number for this work is INCD-23845-O. I hope that the power coming on earlier is of benefit to you. We always aim to provide a 10/10 service, if you feel we have not delivered you a 10/10 service then please call us on 105.",

Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",
