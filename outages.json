Doing this will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut in the future as we appreciate that some customers may have experienced multiple unplanned power cuts in the last 6 months. To complete the work safely, we need to turn your power off to upgrade the poles. To ensure the power is off for the shortest possible time, our contractors Avidety may carry out preparation works prior to the power cut. This work is taking place near Yaugher Lane. A road closure will be in place from 09:00am - 17:00pm to allow the work to be carried out safely. Access to your property will always be provided.",

This has identified 5 electricity poles that need replacing and upgrading. Doing this will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut in the future as we appreciate that some customers may have experienced multiple unplanned power cuts in the last 6 months. To complete the work safely, we need to turn your power off to upgrade the poles. To ensure the power is off for the shortest possible time, our contractors Avidety may carry out preparation works prior to the power cut. This work is taking place near Yaugher Lane. A road closure will be in place from 09:00am - 17:00pm to allow the work to be carried out safely. Access to your property will always be provided.",

The issue was caused by an unexpected fault with some of our network equipment, which our engineers have now replaced.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

Using an average timescale for this type of issue, we're looking to have you back on between 12:30 and 13:30, however we must stress that this time may change, depending on what our staff find.\n\nWe know that a power cut can be very disruptive; we understand this can greatly impact your daily activities and we want to support you however we can. We'll update you with all of our progress, but for more information about this type of fault; here's a short YouTube video https://UKPN.short.gy/fuse. Sent by Lisa at 08:42.",

We believe there may be a fault on our underground electricity cabling in the area, but currently it has not developed to a stage that our staff can pinpoint it. Their tests have proven inconclusive, so for now they have replaced our safety equipment at the substation to get your power back on as quickly as possible.\n\nThis may happen again before we're able to fix it, but if you'd like to talk to us about this, or if your power isn't on call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

They will start running tests at our substation to see how the local network is operating.\n\nIt's quite common for power to be restored briefly and go off again; this is our engineers using testing equipment to energise different sections of our network - this helps to narrow down any possible issues.\n\nOur cabling network is often broken down by smaller sites, and our staff may also check these to test for any problems, and they may also walk the cabling route to see if there are any signs of malfunction that have appeared on the surface. Our time frame hasn't been adjusted, so for now I'll let you know more news as soon as our staff update us.\n\nSent by Theo at 12:36.",

Our current estimated time frame to restore power is between 15:30 and 16:30, but this is based on our staff being able to restore your power by replacing the substation equipment.\n\nAs this has happened several times recently, it indicates a cabling fault. This may have reached a point where our safety equipment will not replace safely, meaning the fault has become visible. If this happens, we'll arrange further specialist teams to attend and repair it. I'll keep you updated.",
