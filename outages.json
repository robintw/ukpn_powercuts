I appreciate losing power multiple times on the same day is frustrating, so thanks for bearing with us while we work to fix these issues.\n\nAt the moment, our estimated time frame for power is between 02:30 and 03:30. However, as before there is a chance this could change depending on what our staff discover when they arrive.\n\nI'll be on hand to advise updates until your power is back up and running, but you can always reach our team on 105 if you need to speak to us.",
