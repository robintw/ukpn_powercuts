The power was switched off to enable our contractors to test a piece of equipment called a transformer to ensure it is functioning properly. Our contractors have advised us that the 28 affected properties will be restored early between approximately 10:45 and 11:00. This is due to the works progressing well and being completed ahead of schedule. Once these works are complete this will improve the reliability of the electricity network.

        "Comment": "Good morning, this is a message from Harry at UK Power Networks regarding the planned power cut which is currently in progress today the 13th November 2025 in the ME9 postcode area. The power was switched off to enable our contractors to test a piece of equipment called a transformer to ensure it is functioning properly. Our contractors have advised us that the 28 affected properties will be restored early between approximately 10:45 and 11:00. This is due to the works progressing well and being completed ahead of schedule. Once these works are complete this will improve the reliability of the electricity network. Our reference number for this work is INCD-326717-U. I hope that the power coming on earlier is of benefit to you. We always aim to provide a 10/10 service, if you feel we have not delivered you a 10/10 service then please call us on 105.",

The power was switched off at 09:00 by our engineers to enable a third party to carry out tree trimming safely around our overhead electricity cables in Lidgate. Our engineers have advised us that works have gone well, and the 36 affected properties will be restored early at approximately 13:50. Once completed and power have been restored to the area it has reduced the possibility of you having an unplanned power cut by stopping these trees from potentially causing damage to our overhead electricity network and have given the third party their desired outcome. Our reference number for this work is INCD-22095-O. I hope that the power coming on earlier is of benefit to you. We always aim to provide a 10/10 service, if you feel we have not delivered you a 10/10 service then please call us on 105. Thank you",

        "Comment": "Good afternoon, this is a message from Alicia at UK Power Networks regarding the planned power cut which is currently in progress today the 13th November 2025 in the CB8 postcode area. The power was switched off at 09:00 by our engineers to enable a third party to carry out tree trimming safely around our overhead electricity cables in Lidgate. Our engineers have advised us that works have gone well, and the 36 affected properties will be restored early at approximately 13:50. Once completed and power have been restored to the area it has reduced the possibility of you having an unplanned power cut by stopping these trees from potentially causing damage to our overhead electricity network and have given the third party their desired outcome. Our reference number for this work is INCD-22095-O. I hope that the power coming on earlier is of benefit to you. We always aim to provide a 10/10 service, if you feel we have not delivered you a 10/10 service then please call us on 105. Thank you",

Doing this will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut in the future as we appreciate some customers may have experienced an unplanned power cut in the last 6 months. To complete the work safely, we need to turn your power off to upgrade the pole. To ensure the power is off for the shortest possible time, our contractors Avidety may carry out preparation works prior to the power cut. This work is taking place on Hanscombe End Road. Two way traffic lights will be in place to allow the work to be carried out safely. Access to your property will always be provided.",

This essential work helps to provide a reliable electricity supply to your property, reducing the risk of any unplanned power cuts in the future, as we understand some customers may have experienced 5 unplanned power cuts in the last 6 months. To keep everyone safe while we carry out these works, we will need to temporarily turn off your electricity. We are taking extra measures to limit the time your power is off and we'll do our best to cause as little disruption as possible. Doing this will improve the reliability of the electricity network in the future. This work is taking place on Swanborough Drove.",

This means we have been able to restore power sooner than we anticipated, we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.",
