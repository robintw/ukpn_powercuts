This has identified 7 cables, 1 service cable and 8 poles that need replacing and upgrading. Doing this will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut in the future as we appreciate your area has been impacted with unplanned power cuts in the last 6 months. To complete the work safely, we need to turn your power off to upgrade the equipment. To ensure the power is off for the shortest possible time, our contractors Avidety may carry out preparation works prior to the power cut. Avidety will need access to the inside of your property to conduct safety checks in the morning before we switch off the power and we will need to do another check when we turn the power back on.

The issue was caused by an unexpected underground cable fault, which our engineers have made repairs to.\n\nWe know that a power cut can be difficult, and I'm sorry for the length of the time you were without your electricity. Please rest assured that our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

For now we have restored your power as quickly as we can.\n\nIf your power isn't on or you would like to talk to us, call us for free on 08003163105. We know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",

They will start running tests at our substation to see how the local network is operating.\n\nIt's quite common for power to be restored briefly and go off again; this is our engineers using testing equipment to energise different sections of our network - this helps to narrow down any possible issues.\n\nOur cabling network is often broken down by smaller sites, and our staff may also check these to test for any problems, and they may also walk the cabling route to see if there are any signs of malfunction that have appeared on the surface. Our time frame hasn't been adjusted, so for now I'll let you know more news as soon as our staff update us.\n\nSent by Aaron at 19:42.",

We need to examine transformers on our electricity poles to check they are functioning properly. This essential work helps to provide a reliable electricity supply to your property, reducing the risk of any unplanned power cuts in the future as we appreciate your area has been impacted with unplanned power cuts in the last 6 months. To keep everyone safe while we carry out these works, we will need to temporarily turn off your electricity. We are taking extra measures to limit the time your power is off and we'll do our best to cause as little disruption as possible. Doing this will improve the reliability of the electricity network in the future. This work is taking place on Brookhouse Road.",

They have diverted power around the underground network fault.\n\nWe know some properties in the area may have faced other recent interruptions, and we're sorry for the extra disruption. Every outage is fully investigated by our engineers, though power may be lost several times before we can safely find and fix the issue. Our customer services team will keep as many customers updated as possible during these investigations. \n\nWe're sorry for the unplanned disruption. If you need to talk to us, or let us know that your power isn't restored, call us on 08003163105.\n",

        "Comment": "Sent by Luke at 18:51 - Our engineers are on their way. We believe the issue is an underground fault that initially interrupted power to 2245 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 609 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 21:00 and 22:00, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

The issue was caused by an unexpected fault with some of our network equipment, which our engineers have now replaced.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

They may also walk our cabling route throughout the area to check for any visible problems, check smaller electrical sites in the area, or apply specialist equipment which may restore power temporarily to help them with their testing.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nWe'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",
