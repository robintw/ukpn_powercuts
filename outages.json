Depending on the fault, it may take several days for our engineers to pinpoint the problem and plan in the work.

The issue was caused by an unexpected damage to our underground cabling, which our engineers have made safe after clearing the damage.\n\nWe know that a power cut can be difficult, and I'm sorry for the length of the time you were without your electricity. Please rest assured that our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

Our engineers have just called in to advise us that they have run into complications on site due to a parked car in the way of where we need to carry on works to the faulty electrical equipment.\n\nUnfortunately, it's going to take us past our current time frame to complete this safely, so we're now working towards between 22:30 and 23:30 to have power back on.\n\nWe can appreciate how frustrating and disruptive being without power can be, and our staff are working as fast as they can. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to speak to our team, but I'll let you know further news as it comes in from site. Sent by David at 18:40.",

However, once they've assessed further we'll let you know if the time frame needs to change.\n\nFor more information about this type of fault; here's a short video https://bit.ly/2ScxQDZ - I'll keep you updated.",
