Our engineers have advised us that works are progressing well and the affected properties will be restored early between at approximately 12:15.

This has identified a span of high voltage cables and 16 poles that need upgrading. Doing this will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut in the future as we appreciate that some customers may have experienced an unplanned power cut in the last 6 months. Our contractors Avidety may carry out preparation works prior to the power cut. During this time, you will be connected to a generator to provide you with electricity whilst we carry out the works. To connect and disconnect the generator we will need to switch off your power temporarily. This work is taking place in and around Cansiron Lane. A road closure will be in place on the 16th of December from 09:00 to 17:00 on Cansiron Lane to allow the work to be carried out safely. Access to your property will always be provided.",

Our engineers had to unexpectedly turn off the power to safely repair an underground network fault in the Chadwell Heath area.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

I'm pleased to report our staff have resolved this by diverting power to get your lights back on as soon as possible.\n\nWe contact customers when we are made aware of problems like this, so if you would like to be notified in future let us know here https://bit.ly/3zyHC6L\n\nI personally apologise for the disruption this caused you.

In addition to this, they are liaising closely with our control room to find safe and reliable ways to divert power around any problems and get everyone restored.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice.

We're pleased that we have been able to restore power sooner than we estimated.\n\nIf your power isn't back on, we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on.

        "Comment": "Sent by Lisa at 10:48 - We believe our engineers have been able to restore power to all 9223 customers in the London SE17 2/SW13 0&9/SW14 8 area by diverting power around an underground cable fault. We're pleased that we have been able to restore power sooner than we estimated.\n\nIf your power isn't back on, we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.",

We know a power cut can be difficult; we're sorry for any disruption this unplanned power cut caused.  \n\nWe know some properties in the area may have faced other recent interruptions, and we're sorry for the extra disruption. Every outage is fully investigated by our engineers, though power may be lost several times before we can safely find and fix the issue. Our customer services team will keep as many customers updated as possible during these investigations.\n\nTo talk to us, or let us know that your power isn't restored, call us on 08003163105.",

We believe the issue is an underground cable fault that initially interrupted power to 1546 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 301 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 1630 - 1730, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

Today's power cut was an unexpected underground network fault that affected 5353 properties, so I'm sorry that we weren't able to provide you with prior notice. I'm pleased to report our staff have resolved this by diverting power to get your lights back on as soon as possible.\n\nWe contact customers when we are made aware of problems like this, so if you would like to be notified in future let us know here https://bit.ly/3zyHC6L\n\nI personally apologise for the disruption this caused you. We aim to provide a 10/10 service in keeping you updated, so if you'd like to talk to us about anything or are still without power, please call us on 105.",

There are now only 3 properties without power, who we'll speak to directly. If you're without power and haven't been contacted, then we'll need to hear from you. Please call us on 08003163105 (free from landlines and mobiles).\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the unexpected outage.
