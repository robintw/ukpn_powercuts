        "Comment": "Sent by Kevin at 21:34 - We can now confirm that all power in the Dunstans Road area should be back on.\n\nOur staff are trying to find the root cause and fix it permanently, however with this kind of issue it's likely that power will go off multiple times before we're able to find and fix it. For now we have restored your power as quickly as we can.\n\nIf your power isn't on or you would like to talk to us, call us for free on 08003163105. We know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",

        "Comment": "Our engineers have now arrived on site in the Dunstans Road area.\n\nAs any issues that currently exist on our network have affected our equipment at the substation, engineers will start their testing there. They will then check our network equipment throughout the area to try and identify any problems, before trying to restore power.\n\nOur estimated time frame of between 22:30 and 23:30 hasn't changed, but if this is not successful it's possible that a cable repair may be needed. This can involve ground excavations, traffic management equipment or specialist teams. As soon as our staff can safely update us, we'll give you the latest news. Sent by Kevin at 20:28.",

Today's power cut was an unexpected underground cable fault that affected several thousand properties, so I'm sorry that we weren't able to provide you with prior notice. I'm pleased to report our staff have resolved this by diverting power to get your lights back on as soon as possible.\n\nWe contact customers when we are made aware of problems like this, so if you would like to be notified in future let us know here https://bit.ly/3zyHC6L\n\nI personally apologise for the disruption this caused you. We aim to provide a 10/10 service in keeping you updated, so if you'd like to talk to us about anything or are still without power, please call us on 105.",

        "Comment": "Sent by Talie at 22:23 - We believe our engineers have been able to restore power to all several thousand customers in the CT15, CT16 and CT17 area by diverting power around the underground cable fault. We're pleased that we have been able to restore power sooner than we estimated.\n\nIf your power isn't back on, we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.",

If you have someone in the property who may be more vulnerable to the cold please do not hesitate to call us free on 105.\n\nWe will do our best to provide additional care and support whilst work continues to get your power back on asap.

As such, they have replaced our substation equipment to restore power as quickly as possible.\n\nI'm sorry this affected your power again today. This may happen again before we're able to pinpoint the issue and fix it, but if you'd like to talk to us about anything or if your power isn't on, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

Our estimated time frame is currently between 00:30-01:30, although as we mentioned previously this can be subject to change.\n\nWe're keeping in touch with our staff regularly to make sure you have the best information to plan ahead.

For now we have restored your power as quickly as we can.\n\nIf your power isn't on or you would like to talk to us, call us for free on 08003163105.
