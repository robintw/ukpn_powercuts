I have spoken to the engineers working in your area and I am pleased to say the works are progressing well and at this stage, we are still aiming to have the power back on between 13:30 and 14:30. Our staff working do appreciate it is colder this time of year, and they will do all they can to get the power back on earlier if possible. Rest assured, if anything changes, we will of course let you know. For any more information, please visit our website or call us on 105. Thank you. VB & SMS sent.",

Our engineers had to unexpectedly turn off the power for safety due to a faulty piece of network equipment  in the Addison Gardens area. They have now been able to divert all power around the faulty equipment.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage.

For now we have restored your power as quickly as we can.\n\nIf your power isn't on or you would like to talk to us, call us for free on 08003163105.

Our engineers have turned off the power in the Dorking RH5 area in the interest of the public's health and safety. This is so they can investigate reports of overhead cables  on the ground.\n\nIf in the area, please take care and stay at least 10m away from the cable. \n\nUntil our engineers arrive on site and investigate, it's difficult to advise you a time frame. However, based on an average for this kind of issue, our estimated time to have you back on is between 03:30 and 04:30. \n\nWe'll keep you updated with our progress, but in the meantime our team are always here to talk on 105 if you have any questions or concerns.",

        "Comment": "What will happen next?\n\nWe have been alerted to a potentially dangerous situation involving overhead cables on the ground, so have responded as quickly as possible and asked our control room to turn power off to the area using our high voltage network. This is why a wide area has lost electricity.\n\nOnce further specialist field staff have assessed the situation, we'll start diverting power back to affected homes as soon as they advise us it's safe. You may notice your lights going on and off as we work to get as much power restored as we can.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",

We believe the issue is an overhead network fault that initially interrupted power to 2658 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 236 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 10:30-11:30, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

For now we have restored your power as quickly as we can.\n\nIf your power isn't on or you would like to talk to us, call us for free on 08003163105. We know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",

        "Comment": "We're sorry your power has gone off again.\n\nWe believe there may be an underlying issue causing the recent power cuts, but due to the nature of the electricity network, the heat created by a developing fault can cause a break in a cable to reseal itself. This can make it difficult to locate, so while our engineers are testing our equipment thoroughly to pinpoint the issue, this kind of problem may interrupt power multiple times before it's possible for us to fix.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nI'll keep you updated. Sent by Kevin at 10:41",

However, this could change once our staff have assessed the local network.\n\nWe believe the power cuts you have been experiencing are caused by a fault with one of the cables. Developing faults can start very small, and so can be hard to detect but each power cut usually makes it easier to see, which means our specialist staff can detect it, and work on the repair to prevent further outages.\n",
