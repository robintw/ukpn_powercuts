Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 09:30-10:30, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

We have already sent staff to the area, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting the electricity around the faulty section. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will locate and repair the issue, which will take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",

Today's power cut was unexpected, so we were unable to provide you with prior notice to help you plan ahead. I am pleased to confirm that we managed to resolve this by repairing our overhead cabling to get your lights back on as soon as possible.\n\nJust so you know, we text customers when we are made aware of problems like this, so if you would like to be notified in the future you can do so here https://bit.ly/3zyHC6L.\n\nThis was a widespread problem on the overhead network and I personally apologise for any disruption this has caused to your day. If you have any questions or are still without power, please call us on 105.",

This is why a wide area has lost electricity.\n\nOur field teams are working to fix the issue as quickly as possible, and we'll start diverting power back to affected homes as soon as they advise us it's safe. You may notice your lights going on and off as we work to get as much power restored as we can.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",

We didn't know this was going to happen, so time frames we provide throughout are estimated and are subject to change.\n\nOur estimated time to have power back on is currently between 16:30 and 17:30, but after we arrive and assess the situation this may change. The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",

Today's power cut was an unexpected overhead network fault that affected 4844 properties, so I'm sorry that we weren't able to provide you with prior notice. I'm pleased to report our staff have resolved this by diverting power to get your lights back on as soon as possible.\n\nWe contact customers when we are made aware of problems like this, so if you would like to be notified in future let us know here https://bit.ly/3zyHC6L\n\nI personally apologise for the disruption this caused you. We aim to provide a 10/10 service in keeping you updated, so if you'd like to talk to us about anything or are still without power, please call us on 105.",

This means we have been able to restore power sooner than we anticipated, we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.",

        "Comment": "What will happen next?\n\nThis outage is affecting multiple areas, so locations we mention may be further away than you'd expect. We have already sent staff to the area, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting the electricity around the faulty section. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will locate and repair the issue, which will take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",

The issue was caused by an unexpected fault with some of our network equipment, which our engineers have now replaced.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",
