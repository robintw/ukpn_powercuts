Our estimated time to have your power back on is between 17:00 and 18:00, however, this may need to change later depending on how our works progress.\n\nIf you'd like more information about why we sometimes have to switch power off to work; here's a short video https://bit.ly/3cYez0V. We'll keep you updated with progress.",

        "Comment": "Sent by Lisa at 19:21 - We can now confirm that all power in the Kelvedon Green area should be back on. The issue was caused by an unexpected fault with some of our network equipment, which our engineers have now replaced.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

Using an average timescale for this type of issue, we're looking to have you back on between 21:30 and 22:30, however we must stress that this time may change, depending on what our staff find.\n\nWe know that a power cut can be very disruptive; we understand this can greatly impact your daily activities and we want to support you however we can. We'll update you with all of our progress, but for more information about this type of fault; here's a short YouTube video https://bit.ly/2y8Dtfz. Sent by Lisa at 18:28.",
