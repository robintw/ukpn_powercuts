        "Comment": "Good morning, this is a message from Harry at UK Power Networks regarding the planned power cut that is scheduled for today the 26th January 2026 in the CO5 postcode area. Our contractors have advised us that unfortunately there is going to be a delay in the power being switched off. This is due to unforeseen delays with the electrical equipment being delivered to site. As this work is taking place in stages, please add an hour on to the original time frame on the letter for the new estimated time for the power to be switched off. Our reference number for this work is INCD-106411-C. We would like to apologise for any inconvenience this may cause you. If you have any questions or you have moved from the CO5 postcode area, then please give us a call on 105.",

Thanks for bearing with us during the power cut, I know the lights being off is a worry.\n\nOur staff have advised that the parked cars have now been moved and ground excavations are underway. Due to the delay this has caused, they've advised a new time of 15:30-16:30 to have your power back on.\n\nI know another delay is frustrating; our engineers always try to give us the best estimate that they can but due to the safety elements of working with live electricity, sometimes they have to adjust their repairs at short notice.\n\nI'm sorry if this has caused you to change any plans you've made, but we'll be here to update you until the lights are safely back on.",

To give them time to do this safely, the estimated time frame to restore your power is now between 12:00 and 13:00.\n\nWe're sorry this is taking longer than expected, and we'll continue to keep you up to date, but if any change to this time comes in from our staff I'll let you know as soon as we hear.",

Today's power cut was an unexpected underground cable fault that affected 3460 properties, so I'm sorry that we weren't able to provide you with prior notice. I'm pleased to report our staff have resolved this by diverting power to get your lights back on as soon as possible.\n\nWe contact customers when we are made aware of problems like this, so if you would like to be notified in future let us know here https://bit.ly/3zyHC6L\n\nI personally apologise for the disruption this caused you. We aim to provide a 10/10 service in keeping you updated, so if you'd like to talk to us about anything or are still without power, please call us on 105.",

They have diverted power around the underground cable fault.\n\nWe know some properties in the area may have faced other recent interruptions, and we're sorry for the extra disruption. Every outage is fully investigated by our engineers, though power may be lost several times before we can safely find and fix the issue. Our customer services team will keep as many customers updated as possible during these investigations. \n\nWe're sorry for the unplanned disruption. If you need to talk to us, or let us know that your power isn't restored, call us on 08003163105.",

        "Comment": "Sent by Talie at 08:55 - Our engineers are on their way. We believe the issue is an underground cable fault that initially interrupted power to 3460 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 120 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 12:00-13:00, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

They have diverted power around a fault on our underground cables.\n\nWe know some properties in the area may have faced other recent interruptions, and we're sorry for the extra disruption. Every outage is fully investigated by our engineers, though power may be lost several times before we can safely find and fix the issue. Our customer services team will keep as many customers updated as possible during these investigations. \n\nWe're sorry for the unplanned disruption. If you need to talk to us, or let us know that your power isn't restored, call us on 08003163105.\n",

Our estimated time to have your power back on is between 12:30 and 13:30, however, this may need to change later depending on how our works progress.\n\nIf you'd like more information about why we sometimes have to switch power off to work; here's a short video https://bit.ly/3cYez0V.
