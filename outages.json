This means we have been able to restore power sooner than we anticipated, we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.\n\n",

        "Comment": "I appreciate your continued patience this morning. We want to be as transparent as possible as we know having multiple power cuts is disruptive and worrying, so I would like to help explain why we can't always fix a problem like this right away.\n\nUnderground electricity cabling is insulated for safety and if a fault develops, these materials can re-seal due to heat passing through them when our safety equipment operates and your power is lost. This covers any potential fault again, meaning our staff cannot locate it using their tests or specialist equipment.\n\nWe'll know more once our staff contact us again, so I'll be in touch again shortly.\n\nSent by Bev at 01:21.",
