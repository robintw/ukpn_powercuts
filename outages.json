For now we have restored your power as quickly as we can.\n\nIf your power isn't on or you would like to talk to us, call us for free on 08003163105. We know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",

        "Comment": "Our staff have now arrived on site in the HA3 5, HA3 7 area. Due to there being multiple power cuts over a short space of time, our engineers are going to start their tests at the nearby substation.\n\nOur current time frame is between 2230 - 2330; this is an estimate based on them checking the state of our network, and attempting to restore your power.\n\nIt's possible that the underground cabling fault we believe has been causing these power cuts has reach a point where they can't safely replace our substation equipment. If this happens we'll need to arrange further teams and equipment, so I'll let you know more news as soon as our staff update us. Sent by Lee at 19:49.",

As such, they have replaced our substation equipment to restore power as quickly as possible.\n\nI'm sorry this affected your power again today.

This can make it difficult to locate, so while our engineers are testing our equipment thoroughly to pinpoint the issue, this kind of problem may interrupt power multiple times before it's possible for us to fix.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nI'll keep you updated. Sent by Decasta at 00:32",

To allow time for us to get the generator out to your area and connect it, we're now estimating we'll have power back on between 11:00 and 12:00.\n\nWe're sorry to change the time frame and will let you know when they arrive.",

In addition to this, they are liaising closely with our control room to find safe and reliable ways to divert power around any problems and get everyone restored.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them. We'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",

We'll continue to update you with all of our progress.\n\nSent by Decasta at 05:46.",
