Our engineers have advised us that the 18 affected properties will be restored early between approximately 14:20 and 14:40. This is due to the works progressing well and being completed ahead of schedule. Once these works are complete this will improve the reliability of the electricity network and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut. Our reference number for this work is INCD-106501-C. I hope that the power coming on earlier is of benefit to you. We always aim to provide a 10/10 service, if you feel we have not delivered you a 10/10 service then please call us on 105.",

Our engineers had to unexpectedly turn off the power to 74 customers in the Chegworth Road area to safely repair an overhead cable on the ground.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

We have now restored power to all but one property. We're sorry for any disruption this unexpected power cut caused.\n\nIf your power isn't back on, we'd still like to keep you updated. If we aren't currently in contact with you by phone or in person at your property, please call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage and how long you were off for. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",

Thanks for bearing with us during the power cut, I know the lights being off is a worry.\n\nOur staff have advised that repairs to the fault are progressing, however it's taking longer than expected. Due to this, they've advised a new time of 01:30-02:30 to have your power back on.\n\nI know another delay is frustrating; our engineers always try to give us the best estimate that they can but due to the safety elements of working with live electricity, sometimes they have to adjust their repairs at short notice.\n\nI'm sorry if this has caused you to change any plans you've made, but we'll be here to update you until the lights are safely back on.",

We have now restored power to all but one property. We're sorry for any disruption this unexpected power cut caused.\n\nIf your power isn't back on, we'd still like to keep you updated. If we aren't currently in contact with you by phone or in person at your property, please call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage.

Our estimated time of 20:00-21:00 hasn't changed.\n\nIf you'd like more information about why we sometimes have to switch power off to work; here's a short video https://bit.ly/3cYez0V. We'll keep you updated with progress.",

If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to speak to our team, but I'll let you know further news as it comes in from site. Sent by Adam at 16:12.",

The suspected underground cabling issue is not yet appearing on any of our tests, so for the moment we have restored your power as quickly as possible.\n\nI'm afraid this may happen again, but every time you lose power it gives us a better chance of pinpointing the problem. I'm sorry for the continued disruption, but If you'd like to talk to us about this, or if your power isn't on call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",
