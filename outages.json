Our engineers have diverted power around the underground network fault to get the majority of customers back on. However, due to the location and complexity of the issue, we have also used temporary generators to restore power to the last of the affected properties. This will provide power until our engineers plan in and safely complete the full repair, which may take a few days.\n\nWe're really sorry for any disruption this unexpected power cut caused, and how long you may have been off for.

Our time frame hasn't been adjusted, so for now I'll let you know more news as soon as our staff update us.\n\nSent by Aaron at 09:29.",
