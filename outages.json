        "Comment": "Good afternoon, this is a message from Ryan at UK Power Networks regarding the planned power cut that is currently in progress today the 20th of November 2025 in the SG12 postcode area. Our contractors have advised that unfortunately there is going to be a delay in restoring your power. This is due to the access issues faced earlier this morning which has had a knock-on effect with completing the works. We now estimate to restore your power between approximately 17:30-18:30. Please note that this is an estimated timeframe. Our reference number for this work is INCD-23836-O. We would like to apologise for any inconvenience this may cause you. If you have any questions or you have moved from the SG12 postcode area, then please call 105.",

We'll continue to liaise with our engineers and keep you updated.  \n\nWe're sorry for the disruption this power cut may be causing. If you're worried about elderly or ill neighbours, we can offer help and support to our vulnerable customers during a power cut. Find out more here: https://bit.ly/40quttu.\n\nIf you have any concerns, please call us on 08003163105",

We have already sent staff to the area, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting the electricity around the faulty section. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will locate and repair the issue, which will take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",

At this point we think the issue is overhead network fault. \n\nSpecialist engineers from our control room are also working to divert power remotely, so it's possible your power could come back on at any point. We can't always restore everyone this way. That's why we're also sending staff to the area to check our equipment.\n\nEvery fault is different, so our time frames have to be estimated but currently we hope to have power back on between 17:00 and 18:00. We must stress that it may become necessary for this to change, depending on what our engineers find.\n\nWe'll keep you updated with our progress.",

Following the results of their tests, the underground cable fault we believe is causing these issues has not yet become visible, so for the moment we have restored your power as fast as possible.\n\nI'm very sorry for the continued disruption, but this may happen again before we're able to fix it. If you'd like to talk to us about this, or if your power isn't on call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

Our engineers have now repaired and re attached the overhead cable that was laying on the ground, and have deemed it safe to restore power back to all 1172 properties in the NR19 2 area.\n\nWe're very sorry we had to turn your power off unexpectedly, and with so little warning. We usually provide much more notice if we can, but in a situation like this our first priority is the safety of the public and our staff.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage.

Our engineers have now repaired and re attached the overhead cable that was laying on the ground, and have deemed it safe to restore power back to all 1172 properties in the NR19 2 area.\n\nWe're very sorry we had to turn your power off unexpectedly, and with so little warning. We usually provide much more notice if we can, but in a situation like this our first priority is the safety of the public and our staff.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. If your power is still off or if you have any questions, call our team on 08003163105.",

We appreciate it can be unsettling to have a power cut during the night, but our engineers work 24 hours on issues like this so we're still aiming to have power restored as soon as possible.\n\nIf you light candles, please be mindful of them and take extra care when using the stairs.

Our engineers have just called in to advise us that they have found an overhead cable laying on the ground in the NR19 2 area, which they are working on repairing and re erecting the cable to be able to restore your power.\n\nUnfortunately, it's going to take us past our current time frame to complete this safely, so we're now working towards between 04:30 and 05:30 to have power back on.\n\nWe can appreciate how frustrating and disruptive being without power can be, and our staff are working as fast as they can. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to speak to our team, but I'll let you know further news as it comes in from site. Sent by David at 02:55.",
