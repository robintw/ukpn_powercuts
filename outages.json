The issue was caused by an unexpected fault, which our engineers have made repairs to.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured that our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",
