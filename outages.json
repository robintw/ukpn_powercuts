The issue was due to an underground cable being struck by a third party, which initially caused our substation equipment to operate for safety in the Park Road area. Our engineers have now diverted power and still have further repairs to complete.\n\nIf your power isn't back on, we'd still like to keep you updated. If we aren't currently in contact with you by phone or in person at your property, please call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage.

Following the results of their tests, the underground cable fault we believe is causing these issues has not yet become visible, so for the moment we have restored your power as fast as possible.\n\nI'm very sorry for the continued disruption, but this may happen again before we're able to fix it. If you'd like to talk to us about this, or if your power isn't on call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

They will then check our network equipment throughout the area to try and identify any problems, before trying to restore power.\n\nOur estimated time frame of 23:30 and 00:30 hasn't changed, but if this is not successful it's possible that a cable repair may be needed. This can involve ground excavations, traffic management equipment or specialist teams. As soon as our staff can safely update us, we'll give you the latest news. Sent by Lisa at 19:25.",

We are sending our engineers back to the Lucknow Road area to investigate why.\n\nCurrently, our time frame for power to be restored is between 23:30 and 00:30, but once our staff arrive on site and assess the situation, this time may change. As there have been other power cuts recently it's difficult to know what repairs will be needed to restore your power safely, so time frames we provide throughout have to be estimated.\n\nThe results of our engineer's tests on our network will let us know if our estimate needs to be adjusted, so we'll update you as soon as they have arrived on site and investigated.",

The issue was caused by an unexpected fault with some of our network equipment, which our engineers have now replaced.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

They may also walk our cabling route throughout the area to check for any visible problems, check smaller electrical sites in the area, or apply specialist equipment which may restore power temporarily to help them with their testing.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nWe'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",

In addition to this, they are liaising closely with our control room to find safe and reliable ways to divert power around any problems and get everyone restored.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them. We'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",
