This has identified 15 cables and 3 poles that need upgrading. Doing this will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut in the future as we appreciate you may have been impacted by an unplanned fault in the last 6 months. To complete the work safely, we need to turn your power off to upgrade the equipment. To ensure the power is off for the shortest possible time, our contractors Avidety may carry out preparation works prior to the power cut. Avidety will need access to the inside of your property to conduct safety checks in the morning before we switch off the power and we will need to do another check when we turn the power back on. This work is taking place near Westward Lane. A road closure will be in place to allow the work to be carried out safely. Access to your property will always be provided.",

For now we have restored your power as quickly as we can.\n\nIf your power isn't on or you would like to talk to us, call us for free on 08003163105. We know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",

They may also walk our cabling route throughout the area to check for any visible problems, check smaller electrical sites in the area, or apply specialist equipment which may restore power temporarily to help them with their testing.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nWe'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",

However, once they've assessed further we'll let you know if the time frame needs to change.\n\nFor more information about this type of fault; here's a short video https://bit.ly/2ScxQDZ - I'll keep you updated.",

        "Comment": "We're sorry your power has gone off again.\n\nWe believe there may be an underlying issue causing the recent power cuts, but due to the nature of the electricity network, the heat created by a developing fault can cause a break in a cable to reseal itself. This can make it difficult to locate, so while our engineers are testing our equipment thoroughly to pinpoint the issue, this kind of problem may interrupt power multiple times before it's possible for us to fix.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nI'll keep you updated. Sent by Theo at 23:25",

They will start running tests at our substation to see how the local network is operating.\n\nIt's quite common for power to be restored briefly and go off again; this is our engineers using testing equipment to energise different sections of our network - this helps to narrow down any possible issues.\n\nOur cabling network is often broken down by smaller sites, and our staff may also check these to test for any problems, and they may also walk the cabling route to see if there are any signs of malfunction that have appeared on the surface. Our time frame hasn't been adjusted, so for now I'll let you know more news as soon as our staff update us.\n\nSent by Theo at 23:11.",

At this point we think the issue is an overhead cable fault affecting 86 properties.\n\nSpecialist engineers from our control room are also working to divert power remotely, so it's possible your power could come back on at any point. We can't always restore everyone this way. That's why we're also sending staff to the area to check our equipment.\n\nEvery fault is different, so our time frames have to be estimated but currently we hope to have power back on between 08:30 and 09:30. We must stress that it may become necessary for this to change, depending on what our engineers find.\n\nWe'll keep you updated with our progress.",

Today's power cut was an unexpected overhead cable fault that affected 2485 properties, so I'm sorry that we weren't able to provide you with prior notice. I'm pleased to report our staff have resolved this by diverting power to get your lights back on as soon as possible.\n\nWe contact customers when we are made aware of problems like this, so if you would like to be notified in future let us know here https://bit.ly/3zyHC6L\n\nI personally apologise for the disruption this caused you.

This means we have been able to restore power sooner than we anticipated, we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.",

Thanks for your patience today, our field staff and control room engineers have worked to get your power back on as quickly as they can.\n\nOur records show that some properties affected by today's power cut may have had other unexpected interruptions recently. If you have, we're sorry for further disruption. All power cuts are fully investigated by our engineers but can sometimes happen multiple times before we can safely find the issue and fix it.\n\nWe know that not everyone affected by today's power cut will have had other power cuts recently, but we want you to know that if you have, our customer services team will try to update as many customers as possible about our investigations.",
