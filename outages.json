There are now only 2 properties without power, who we'll speak to directly. If you're without power and haven't been contacted, then we'll need to hear from you. Please call us on 08003163105 (free from landlines and mobiles).\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the unexpected outage and how long you were off for. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",

We have now restored power to all but one property. We're sorry for any disruption this unexpected power cut caused.\n\nIf your power isn't back on, we'd still like to keep you updated. If we aren't currently in contact with you by phone or in person at your property, please call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",

In addition to this, they are liaising closely with our control room to find safe and reliable ways to divert power around any problems and get everyone restored.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them. We'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",

This can make it difficult to locate, so while our engineers are testing our equipment thoroughly to pinpoint the issue, this kind of problem may interrupt power multiple times before it's possible for us to fix.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nI'll keep you updated. Sent by Adam at 16:35",

They will start running tests at our substation to see how the local network is operating.\n\nIt's quite common for power to be restored briefly and go off again; this is our engineers using testing equipment to energise different sections of our network - this helps to narrow down any possible issues.\n\nOur cabling network is often broken down by smaller sites, and our staff may also check these to test for any problems, and they may also walk the cabling route to see if there are any signs of malfunction that have appeared on the surface. Our time frame hasn't been adjusted, so for now I'll let you know more news as soon as our staff update us.\n\nSent by Adam at 16:10.",

The suspected underground cabling issue is not yet appearing on any of our tests, so for the moment we have restored your power as quickly as possible.\n\nI'm afraid this may happen again, but every time you lose power it gives us a better chance of pinpointing the problem. I'm sorry for the continued disruption, but If you'd like to talk to us about this, or if your power isn't on call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

They will start running tests at our substation to see how the local network is operating.\n\nIt's quite common for power to be restored briefly and go off again; this is our engineers using testing equipment to energise different sections of our network - this helps to narrow down any possible issues.\n\nOur cabling network is often broken down by smaller sites, and our staff may also check these to test for any problems, and they may also walk the cabling route to see if there are any signs of malfunction that have appeared on the surface. Our time frame hasn't been adjusted, so for now I'll let you know more news as soon as our staff update us.\n\nSent by Talie at 21:18.",

As such, they have replaced our substation equipment to restore power as quickly as possible.\n\nI'm sorry this affected your power again today.

This can make it difficult to locate, so while our engineers are testing our equipment thoroughly to pinpoint the issue, this kind of problem may interrupt power multiple times before it's possible for us to fix.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nI'll keep you updated. Sent by Simon at 23:28",
