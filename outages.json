We believe there may be a fault on our underground electricity cabling in the area, but currently it has not developed to a stage that our staff can pinpoint it. Their tests have proven inconclusive, so for now they have replaced our safety equipment at the substation to get your power back on as quickly as possible.\n\nThis may happen again before we're able to fix it, but if you'd like to talk to us about this, or if your power isn't on call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

For now we have restored your power as quickly as we can.\n\nIf your power isn't on or you would like to talk to us, call us for free on 08003163105.
