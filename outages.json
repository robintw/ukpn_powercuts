The issue was caused by an unexpected fault on our underground cables, which our engineers have repaired.\n\nWe know that a power cut can be difficult, and I'm sorry for the length of the time you were without your electricity. Please rest assured that our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

To stop SMS updates, visit our website here - https://bit.ly/348KOZ3.\n\nIf your power is still affected, our engineers have been in touch to advise that excavations are taking longer than expected. Due to this, we're now estimating that we'll have the remaining power restored by 02:30 and 03:30.\n\nWe're very sorry to adjust our time frame, but we'll continue to keep you updated with all of our progress.",

This means we have been able to restore power sooner than we anticipated, we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.",

Our engineers had to unexpectedly turn off the power to 18 additional customers in the Milton Keynes MK17 9 area to safely repair damage to the network, caused by a road traffic collision.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

Our engineers have now investigated the overhead cable on the ground, and have deemed it safe to restore power back to all 665 properties in the Milton Keynes MK17 9 & Dunstable LU5 6 area.\n\nWe're very sorry we had to turn your power off unexpectedly, and with so little warning. We usually provide much more notice if we can, but in a situation like this our first priority is the safety of the public and our staff.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. If your power is still off or if you have any questions, call our team on 08003163105.",
