        "Comment": "Good morning, this is a message from Alicia at UK Power Networks regarding the planned power cut that is scheduled for today the 29th January 2026 in the DA2 postcode area. Our engineers have advised us that due to traffic delays causing our engineers arriving to site later than planned there is going to be a delay in the power being switched off. Customers will now be switched off by approximately 10:30. Our reference number for this work is INCD-327168-U. We would like to apologise for any inconvenience this may cause you. If you have any questions or you have moved from the DA2 postcode area, then please give us a call on 105",

There are now only 2 properties without power, who we'll speak to directly. If you're without power and haven't been contacted, then we'll need to hear from you. Please call us on 08003163105 (free from landlines and mobiles).\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the unexpected outage and how long you were off for.

Our engineers previously diverted electricity around the fault, however this diversion has not held. They are continuing their work on site and are now aiming to have you back on between 01:00 and 02:00.\n\nWe will continue to keep you informed of progress.

We understand how difficult a power cut can be, so we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.",

Just to let you know.\n\nOur specialist cable jointers have so far been unable to pinpoint the underground cabling fault, so they have instructed our digging gang to excavate our cabling. This will allow them to cut our cable, and using specialist equipment, test each side to help narrow down where the fault lies.\n\nDue to the extent of work still required to locate and the repair the faulty underground electrical equipment we have had to change the estimated timeframe to between 17:00-18:00. We'll continue to keep you updated, but our team are always here on 08003163105 from any phone if you have any questions. Sent by David at 09:51.",

All power cuts are fully investigated by our engineers but can sometimes happen multiple times before we can safely find the issue and fix it.\n\nWe know that not everyone affected by today's power cut will have had other power cuts recently, but we want you to know that if you have, our customer services team will try to update as many customers as possible about our investigations.",

The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",

We didn't know this was going to happen, so time frames we provide throughout are estimated and are subject to change.\n\nOur estimated time to have power back on is currently between 13:30 and 14:30, but after we arrive and assess the situation this may change. The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",
