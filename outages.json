This has identified cables and 6 poles that need replacing and upgrading. We will also be replacing stay wires and transferring service cables to the new poles. Doing this will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut in the future as we appreciate your area has been impacted with unplanned power cuts in the last 6 months. To complete the work safely, we need to turn your power off to upgrade the equipment. To ensure the power is off for the shortest possible time, our contractors may carry out preparation works prior to the power cut. This work is taking place in Cooks Drove. A road closure will be in place to allow the work to be carried out safely. Access to your property will always be provided.",

        "Comment": "Sent by Will at 00:02 - Engineers are on their way. At this point we think the issue is a fault with equipment in your local substation in the James Street area. We didn't know this was going to happen, so time frames we provide throughout are estimated and are subject to change.\n\nOur estimated time to have power back on is currently between 04:30 and 05:30, but after we arrive and assess the situation this may change. The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",

Using an average timescale for this type of issue, we're looking to have you back on between 03:30 and 04:30, however we must stress that this time may change, depending on what our staff find.\n\nWe know that a power cut can be very disruptive; we understand this can greatly impact your daily activities and we want to support you however we can. We'll update you with all of our progress, but for more information about this type of fault; here's a short YouTube video https://bit.ly/2y8Dtfz. Sent by Will at 00:50.",
