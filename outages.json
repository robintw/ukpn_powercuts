We didn't know this was going to happen, so time frames we provide throughout are estimated and are subject to change.\n\nOur estimated time to have power back on is currently between 17:00 and 18:00, but after we arrive and assess the situation this may change. The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",

For now we have restored your power as quickly as we can.\n\nIf your power isn't on or you would like to talk to us, call us for free on 08003163105. We know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",

        "Comment": "We're sorry your power has gone off again.\n\nWe believe there may be an underlying issue causing the recent power cuts, but due to the nature of the electricity network, the heat created by a developing fault can cause a break in a cable to reseal itself. This can make it difficult to locate, so while our engineers are testing our equipment thoroughly to pinpoint the issue, this kind of problem may interrupt power multiple times before it's possible for us to fix.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nI'll keep you updated. Sent by Stuart at 12:39.",

Originally, we believed this issue to be a fault on our network, but we have been made aware that due to reports of a snapped pole and grounded overhead cables, our engineers have had to turn power off remotely in the interest of public safety.\n\nWe'll let you know once engineers get to site, and we'll turn your power back on once they have investigated and confirmed the area is safe.\n\nWe'll continue to keep you updated with our progress.",

This is why a wide area has lost electricity.\n\nOnce further specialist field staff have assessed the situation, we'll start diverting power back to affected homes as soon as they advise us it's safe. You may notice your lights going on and off as we work to get as much power restored as we can.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",
