This means we have been able to restore power sooner than we anticipated, we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on.

We believe our engineers have been able to restore power to all 275 customers in the RH5 5 area, by removing the trees that were laying on the overhead cables This means we have been able to restore power sooner than we anticipated, we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on.",

Our engineers are still on site in the Dorking, RH5 5 area working with the tree cutters to remove a large amount of trees that have fallen onto our overhead electrical cables. Once these are removed the engineers will work on repairs to the cables and restore your power. At the moment we don't need to change the estimated timeframe.\n\nIf you have a vulnerable person at home, please call us on 08003163105 and we'll see if we can provide any additional support.",

        "Comment": "Sent by Roland at 08:47 - I appreciate your continued patience during the power cut today. Our staff are working as quickly as they can to get the lights back on, and they've advised us that there are now 429 properties still affected.\n\nThey have managed to get a further 118 of our customers back on by diverting electricity, so your power may have come on sooner than we originally advised.\n\nIf you're still off, please don't worry; work on the issue will continue along with SMS updates until everyone is back on.\n\nTo stop receiving texts, just follow this link https://bit.ly/348KOZ3 to unsubscribe.",

Our engineers have restored power to all 98 properties in the RH12 4 area, and we're pleased that this is sooner than we estimated. They have removed a tree that was laying on the cables.\n\nWe know some properties in the area may have faced other recent interruptions, and we're sorry for the extra disruption. Every outage is fully investigated by our engineers, though power may be lost several times before we can safely find and fix the issue. Our customer services team will keep as many customers updated as possible during these investigations. \n\nIf you need to talk to us, or let us know that your power isn't restored, call us on 08003163105.",

In addition to this, they are liaising closely with our control room to find safe and reliable ways to divert power around any problems and get everyone restored.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice.

We have already sent staff to the area, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting the electricity around the faulty section. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will locate and repair the issue, which will take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",

We believe the issue is a fault on our overhead cables that initially interrupted power to 1735 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 820 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 15:00 and 16:00, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

We believe the issue is an overhead network fault that initially interrupted power to 682 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 517 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 15:30-16:30, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there.

We believe the issue is an overhead network fault that initially interrupted power to 682 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 517 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 15:30-16:30, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

We have already sent staff to the area, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting the electricity around the faulty section. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will locate and repair the issue, which will take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",
