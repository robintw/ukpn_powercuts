Thanks for your patience today, our field staff and control room engineers are working to get your power back on as quickly as they can.\n\nOur records show that some properties affected by today's power cut may have had other unexpected interruptions recently. If you have, we're sorry for further disruption. All power cuts are fully investigated by our engineers but can sometimes happen multiple times before we can safely find the issue and fix it.\n\nWe know that not everyone affected by today's power cut will have had other power cuts recently, but we want you to know that if you have, our customer services team will try to update as many customers as possible about our investigations.",

Thanks for your patience today, I can see from our engineer's notes that your lights may have come on and gone back off several times since we've been made aware of the issue, and I'm sorry if this is causing you any worry.\n\nAs we've explained in previous messages, our staff work to divert power when a fault like this happens. Sometimes, these diversions can be unsuccessful, so we have to try routing power another way; this is why your lights are going off and on.\n\nIf at any point your power comes back on, you can always stop SMS updates here - https://bit.ly/348KOZ3",

        "Comment": "Sent by Adam at 16:39 - Our engineers are on their way. We believe the issue is an overhead network fault that initially interrupted power to 2190 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 541properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 17:30-18:30, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

At this point we think the issue is an overhead cable fault affecting 2203 properties.\n\nSpecialist engineers from our control room are also working to divert power remotely, so it's possible your power could come back on at any point. We can't always restore everyone this way. That's why we're also sending staff to the area to check our equipment.\n\nEvery fault is different, so our time frames have to be estimated but currently we hope to have power back on between 18:30 and 19:30. We must stress that it may become necessary for this to change, depending on what our engineers find.\n\nWe'll keep you updated with our progress.",

Our team of cable jointers have now identified the suspected section of faulted underground cabling using their specialist equipment.\n\nOur digging team will now begin excavations, and this can take some time depending on the surface material, and how much space is needed to allow our engineers to assess the fault and make their repairs safely. \n\nOur estimated time frame of 22:30 and 23:30 doesn't need to change currently. We'll continue to keep you updated, but our team are always here if you have any questions.",

We have already sent staff to the area, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting the electricity around the faulty section. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will locate and repair the issue, which will take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",

We have already sent staff to the area, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting the electricity around the faulty section. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will locate and repair the issue, which will take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",

Today's power cut was an unexpected overhead network fault that affected 1134 properties, so I'm sorry that we weren't able to provide you with prior notice. I'm pleased to report our staff have resolved this by diverting power to get your lights back on as soon as possible.\n\nWe contact customers when we are made aware of problems like this, so if you would like to be notified in future let us know here https://bit.ly/3zyHC6L\n\nI personally apologise for the disruption this caused you. We aim to provide a 10/10 service in keeping you updated, so if you'd like to talk to us about anything or are still without power, please call us on 105.",

Our staff have confirmed they have diverted power around the overhead network fault and managed to restore power to the King's Lynn, PE32 1 and PE33 0 area by approximately 14:46.\n\nWe apologise that this final update is delayed. After restoring supplies, our engineers first need to carry out essential safety tests before they are able to call us to confirm that everyone has been restored.\n\nWe're sorry for any disruption caused by this unexpected power cut, but if your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.

Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point.

We understand how difficult a power cut can be, we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on.

        "Comment": "Sent by Will at 15:18 - We believe our engineers have been able to restore power to all 3831 customers in the Crawley, RH10 7 area, by diverting power around the underground network fault. This means we have been able to restore power sooner than we anticipated, we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.",
