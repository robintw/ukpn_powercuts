This has identified 21 electricity poles that need upgrading. Doing this will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut in the future. Our contractors Avidety may carry out preparation works prior to the power cut as we appreciate your area has been impacted with unplanned power cuts in the last 6 months. During this time, you will be connected to a generator to provide you with electricity whilst we carry out the works. To connect and disconnect the generator we will need to switch off your power temporarily. This work is taking place in multiple locations near Hampton Lane, Bulltown Lane, School Lane and Weekes Lane. Multiple road closures will be in place to allow the work to be carried out safely.",

They may also walk our cabling route throughout the area to check for any visible problems, check smaller electrical sites in the area, or apply specialist equipment which may restore power temporarily to help them with their testing.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nWe'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",

Our engineers had to unexpectedly turn off the power to 1345 customers in the Haverhill CB9 7 and Halstead CO9 4 area to safely repair some faulty overhead network equipment.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

Originally, we believed this issue to be a fault on our network, but we have been made aware that due to some faulty overhead network equipment, our engineers have had to turn power off remotely in the interest of public safety.\n\nWe have a team on site carrying out the repairs and at this stage we're estimating to have the power back on between 13:00 and 14:00. We'll continue to keep you updated with our progress.",

        "Comment": "Sent by Roland at 15:11 - We believe our engineers have been able to restore power to all 1697 customers in the Rochester ME1 / Chatham ME4 area by diverting power around an underground cable fault. We're pleased that we have been able to restore power sooner than we estimated.\n\nIf your power isn't back on, we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.\n",
