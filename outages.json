The power was switched off at 09:05 to enable our engineers to carry out tree trimming around our overhead electricity cables near High Easter Road. Our engineers have advised us that the 26 affected properties will be restored early by approx. 14:00 due to the works being completed earlier than planned. Now these works have been completed, this will improve the reliability of the electricity network and reduce the risk of a tree related unplanned power cut in the future. Our reference number for this work is INCD-24325-O. I hope that the power coming on earlier is of benefit to you. We always aim to provide a 10/10 service, if you feel we have not delivered you a 10/10 service then please call us on 105. VB & SMS sent.",

        "Comment": "Good afternoon, this is a message from Sam at UK Power Networks regarding the planned power cut which is in progress today the 11th of February 2026 in the CM1 postcode area. The power was switched off at 09:05 to enable our engineers to carry out tree trimming around our overhead electricity cables near High Easter Road. Our engineers have advised us that the 26 affected properties will be restored early by approx. 14:00 due to the works being completed earlier than planned. Now these works have been completed, this will improve the reliability of the electricity network and reduce the risk of a tree related unplanned power cut in the future. Our reference number for this work is INCD-24325-O. I hope that the power coming on earlier is of benefit to you. We always aim to provide a 10/10 service, if you feel we have not delivered you a 10/10 service then please call us on 105. VB & SMS sent.",

The suspected underground cabling issue is not yet appearing on any of our tests, so for the moment we have restored your power as quickly as possible.\n\nI'm afraid this may happen again, but every time you lose power it gives us a better chance of pinpointing the problem. I'm sorry for the continued disruption, but If you'd like to talk to us about this, or if your power isn't on call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

I know having power cuts as often as this must be very disruptive, and our staff are doing everything they can to get this resolved.\n\nThey are still testing our network in the area, and depending on the local infrastructure this can take some time. However, once they update us we'll know if our estimated time frame needs to change and why, and I'll let you know as soon as we hear.\n\nIn the meantime, if we can offer any support or advice, our team are always available to talk on 105.\n\nSent by Talie at 21:39.",

They will start running tests at our substation to see how the local network is operating.\n\nIt's quite common for power to be restored briefly and go off again; this is our engineers using testing equipment to energise different sections of our network - this helps to narrow down any possible issues.\n\nOur cabling network is often broken down by smaller sites, and our staff may also check these to test for any problems, and they may also walk the cabling route to see if there are any signs of malfunction that have appeared on the surface. Our time frame hasn't been adjusted, so for now I'll let you know more news as soon as our staff update us.\n\nSent by Talie at 21:18.",

Our engineers had to unexpectedly turn off the power to safely repair an underground cable fault in the Green Street area.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

As such, they have replaced our substation equipment to restore power as quickly as possible.\n\nI'm sorry this affected your power again today. This may happen again before we're able to pinpoint the issue and fix it, but if you'd like to talk to us about anything or if your power isn't on, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

Our estimated time frame is currently between 07:00 and 08:00, although as we mentioned previously this can be subject to change.\n\nWe're keeping in touch with our staff regularly to make sure you have the best information to plan ahead.

Thanks for your patience today, our field staff and control room engineers have worked to get your power back on as quickly as they can.\n\nOur records show that some properties affected by today's power cut may have had other unexpected interruptions recently. If you have, we're sorry for further disruption. All power cuts are fully investigated by our engineers but can sometimes happen multiple times before we can safely find the issue and fix it.\n\nWe know that not everyone affected by today's power cut will have had other power cuts recently, but we want you to know that if you have, our customer services team will try to update as many customers as possible about our investigations.",

Our engineers have diverted power around the overhead cable fault to get the majority of customers back on. However, due to the location and complexity of the issue, we have also used temporary generators to restore power to the last of the affected properties. This will provide power until our engineers plan in and safely complete the full repair, which may take a few days.\n\nWe're really sorry for any disruption this unexpected power cut caused. If your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

We've had an update from our staff that there are now 253 properties still affected by the faulty overhead electrical equipment, as they have managed to safely divert some power, getting the lights back on for 127 of our customers.\n\nWe'll keep sending text updates to everyone until all the power to your area is on.

Our estimated time to have your power back on is between 17:30 and 18:30, however, this may need to change later depending on how our works progress.\n\nIf you'd like more information about why we sometimes have to switch power off to work; here's a short video https://bit.ly/3cYez0V.
