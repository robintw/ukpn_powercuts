        "Comment": "Good morning, this is a message from Ryan at UK Power Networks regarding the planned power cut that is scheduled for today the 5th of December 2025 in the CB8 postcode area. Our contractors have advised us that unfortunately there is going to be a delay in the power being switched off. This is due to them still re-configuring the network before the power can safely be switched off. We now estimate to switch off your power at approximately 11:15. Our contractors are hopeful that the delay in the power being switched off will not result in a delay in power being restored. Our reference number for this work is INCD-23813-O. We would like to apologise for any inconvenience this may cause you. If you have any questions or you have moved from the CB8 postcode area, then please call 105.",

        "Comment": "Sent by Will at 00:27 - We believe our engineers have been able to restore power to all 2495 customers in the Rye, TN31 6 area, by diverting power around the overhead network fault. This means we have been able to restore power sooner than we anticipated, we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.",

        "Comment": "Sent by Theo at 13:09 - We believe our engineers have been able to restore power to all 1816 customers in the BR6 and TN14 area by diverting power around an underground network fault. We're pleased that we have been able to restore power sooner than we estimated.\n\nIf your power isn't back on, we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.",

We understand how difficult a power cut can be,, we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on.

In addition to this, they are liaising closely with our control room to find safe and reliable ways to divert power around any problems and get everyone restored.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them. We'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",
