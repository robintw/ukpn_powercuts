The recent issues were being caused by an unexpected underground cabling fault, which our engineers have now repaired.\n\nWe know this has interrupted your power several times, and we're sorry the power cut today lasted longer than the others. We don't expect this issue to affect your power again, but we'll monitor the situation closely. Rest assured our staff will work around the clock to get your lights back on.\n\nIf your power isn't on, or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105, free from landlines and mobiles.",

We believe the issue is an underground cable fault that initially interrupted power to 1002 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so eight properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 00:00-01:00, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

For now we have restored your power as quickly as we can.\n\nIf your power isn't on or you would like to talk to us, call us for free on 08003163105. We know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",

It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will locate and repair the issue, which will take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",
