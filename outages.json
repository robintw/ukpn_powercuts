However, once they've assessed further we'll let you know if the time frame needs to change.\n\nFor more information about this type of fault; here's a short video https://bit.ly/2ScxQDZ - I'll keep you updated.",

We understand how difficult a power cut can be, we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.",

I'm sorry for the power cut today; I know the lights going off can be disruptive.\n\nWe know that some customers affected by todays power cut may have had other issues recently, and I appreciate this is frustrating. High voltage cabling can cover a wide area, so sometimes properties very close to you may have had power cuts that you didn't experience.\n\nI know you may not have had any previous power cuts, but if you have, we often get progress updates from our field staff management about investigations into repeat issues, and our Customer Services team will try to contact everyone affected by them to explain what's happening.",

Thanks for your patience today, I can see from our engineer's notes that your lights may have come on and gone back off several times since we've been made aware of the issue, and I'm sorry if this is causing you any worry.\n\nAs we've explained in previous messages, our staff work to divert power when a fault like this happens. Sometimes, these diversions can be unsuccessful, so we have to try routing power another way; this is why your lights are going off and on.\n\nIf at any point your power comes back on, you can always stop SMS updates here - https://bit.ly/348KOZ3",

They are working to check smaller sites along our network, known as link boxes. These have very heavy metal lids, and for safety our engineer needs further staff to help.\n\nOur estimated time frame of 17:00 and 18:00 hasn't changed.

We didn't know this was going to happen, so time frames we provide throughout are estimated and are subject to change.\n\nOur estimated time to have power back on is currently between 17:00 and 18:00, but after we arrive and assess the situation this may change. The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",

This is because every power cut increases the chance of the fault has developing to a point that our specialist teams can pinpoint it using specialist equipment. I'll let you know once our teams arrive.",
