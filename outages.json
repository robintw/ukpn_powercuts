Thanks for your patience today, we're happy to say our staff have now restored power to all but two properties in the High Street area. I'm sorry for any disruption we caused by having to turn off your power to repair an unexpected damage to our underground electrical equipment caused by another company.\n\nWe'd still like to keep you informed if your electricity hasn't been restored. Please call us free any time on 08003163105 if we haven't already reached out to you by phone or in person at your property.\n\nWe apologise for the outage and understand that being without power can be challenging. Rest assured that our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep your lights on.",

Our estimated time to have your power back on is between 20:00 and 21:00, however, this may need to change later depending on how our works progress.\n\nIf you'd like more information about why we sometimes have to switch power off to work; here's a short video https://bit.ly/3cYez0V.

To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on.

Every outage is fully investigated by our engineers, though power may be lost several times before we can safely find and fix the issue. Our customer services team will keep as many customers updated as possible during these investigations. \n\nWe're sorry for the unplanned disruption.

Following the results of their tests, the underground cable fault we believe is causing these issues has not yet become visible, so for the moment we have restored your power as fast as possible.\n\nI'm very sorry for the continued disruption, but this may happen again before we're able to fix it.

They may also walk our cabling route throughout the area to check for any visible problems, check smaller electrical sites in the area, or apply specialist equipment which may restore power temporarily to help them with their testing.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nWe'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",

We believe there may be an underlying issue causing this, but it is proving difficult for our engineers to locate and therefore fix. To get your power back on today we have reconfigured the local electricity network. This in turn will both help pinpoint the issue and minimise further interruptions.\n\nIf you'd like more information on the issue, or if your power isn't back on, call us on 08003163105.
