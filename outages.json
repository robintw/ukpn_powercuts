They will start running tests at our substation to see how the local network is operating.\n\nIt's quite common for power to be restored briefly and go off again; this is our engineers using testing equipment to energise different sections of our network - this helps to narrow down any possible issues.\n\nOur cabling network is often broken down by smaller sites, and our staff may also check these to test for any problems, and they may also walk the cabling route to see if there are any signs of malfunction that have appeared on the surface. Our time frame hasn't been adjusted, so for now I'll let you know more news as soon as our staff update us.\n\nSent by Adam at 06:20.",

Our estimated time to have your power back on is between 12:00 and 13:00, however, this may need to change later depending on how our works progress.\n\nIf you'd like more information about why we sometimes have to switch power off to work; here's a short video https://bit.ly/3cYez0V.

Our engineers are still onsite and awaiting more equipment, to repair a fault in the CO7 6 area. We have managed to get power restored to 769 properties, so currently 62 properties are still affected by the overhead cable fault\n\nWe are still aiming to have the power back on between 1600 - 1600. If your power is back on now, please follow this link https://bit.ly/348KOZ3 to stop SMS updates.\n\nI'm sorry for the continued disruption, but I'll keep you informed with news from site.
