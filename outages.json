Our engineers have advised us that the 125 affected properties will be restored early at approximately 11:00 as the works have progressed well. We can confirm that once power has been restored to the area that the works to transfer sections of cables to a different substation on Willan Road will be completed which will improve the reliability of the network and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut in the future.

        "Comment": "Good morning, this is a message from Ryan at UK Power Networks regarding the planned power cut which is currently in progress today the 22nd of January 2026 in the N17 postcode area. Our engineers have advised us that the 125 affected properties will be restored early at approximately 11:00 as the works have progressed well. We can confirm that once power has been restored to the area that the works to transfer sections of cables to a different substation on Willan Road will be completed which will improve the reliability of the network and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut in the future. Our reference number for this work is INCD-24179-O. I hope that the power coming on earlier is of benefit to you. We always aim to provide a 10/10 service, if you feel we have not delivered you a 10/10 service then please call us on 105.",

Our engineers have now safely connected a temporary generator, and this will be providing your power while our engineers work to fully repair the unexpected high voltage network fault.\n\nDepending on what the issue is, it may take a few days for our engineers to plan in the work and make their repairs, but once this is completed safely the generator can be removed, and network power will be resumed.\n\nWe're sorry for the length of time that you were without power. If you'd like any further information, or if your power is not restored, please call us any time on 08003163105.",

Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

They may also walk our cabling route throughout the area to check for any visible problems, check smaller electrical sites in the area, or apply specialist equipment which may restore power temporarily to help them with their testing.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice.

This can make it difficult to locate, so while our engineers are testing our equipment thoroughly to pinpoint the issue, this kind of problem may interrupt power multiple times before it's possible for us to fix.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nI'll keep you updated. Sent by Kevin at 11:11",

The issue was caused by another company damaging an underground cable, which our engineers have diverted the power around and replaced some network safety equipment.\n\nWe know that a power cut can be difficult, and I'm sorry for the length of the time you were without your electricity. Please rest assured that our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

Please only attempt this if you are confident it can be done safely.\n\nIf you have someone in the property who may be more vulnerable to the cold please do not hesitate to call us free on 105.\n\nWe will do our best to provide additional care and support whilst work continues to get your power back on ASAP.",

It's possible they will still be able to restore your power within the current time frame using other methods, but it's also possible our time frame will need to change.\n\nI'll let you know further news as soon as we get it, but if you have any concerns our team are always here on 08003163105.
