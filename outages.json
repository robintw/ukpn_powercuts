Our engineers have diverted power around the grounded cables to get the majority of customers back on. However, due to the location and complexity of the issue, we have also used temporary generators to restore power to the last of the affected properties. These will provide power until our engineers plan in and safely complete the full repair, which may take a few days.\n\nWe're really sorry for any disruption this unexpected power cut caused.

Due to there being multiple power cuts over a short space of time, our engineers are going to start their tests at the nearby substation.\n\nOur current time frame is between 17:30 and 18:30; this is an estimate based on them checking the state of our network, and attempting to restore your power.\n\nIt's possible that the underground cabling fault we believe has been causing these power cuts has reach a point where they can't safely replace our substation equipment. If this happens we'll need to arrange further teams and equipment, so I'll let you know more news as soon as our staff update us. Sent by Aaron at 14:16.",

We believe the issue is an overhead network fault that initially interrupted power to 682 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 517 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 15:30-16:30, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

We have already sent staff to the area, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting the electricity around the faulty section. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will locate and repair the issue, which will take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",

We know a power cut can be difficult; we're sorry for any disruption this unplanned power cut caused.  \n\nWe know some properties in the area may have faced other recent interruptions, and we're sorry for the extra disruption. Every outage is fully investigated by our engineers, though power may be lost several times before we can safely find and fix the issue. Our customer services team will keep as many customers updated as possible during these investigations.\n\nTo talk to us, or let us know that your power isn't restored, call us on 08003163105.\n\n\n\n",

Our engineers have now safely connected temporary generator, and this will be providing your power while our engineers work to fully repair the unexpected underground cable fault.\n\nDepending on what the issue is, it may take a few days for our engineers to plan in the work and make their repairs, but once this is completed safely the generator can be removed, and network power will be resumed.\n\nWe're very sorry for the disruption, especially on Christmas Day.\n\nIf you'd like any further information, or if your power is not restored, please call us any time on 08003163105.",

Thanks for your patience today, our field staff and control room engineers are working to get your power back on as quickly as they can.\n\nOur records show that some properties affected by today's power cut may have had other unexpected interruptions recently. If you have, we're sorry for further disruption. All power cuts are fully investigated by our engineers but can sometimes happen multiple times before we can safely find the issue and fix it.\n\nWe know that not everyone affected by today's power cut will have had other power cuts recently, but we want you to know that if you have, our customer services team will try to update as many customers as possible about our investigations.",
