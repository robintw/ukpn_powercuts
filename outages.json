We have now restored power to all but one property. We're sorry for any disruption this unexpected power cut caused.\n\nIf your power isn't back on, we'd still like to keep you updated. If we aren't currently in contact with you by phone or in person at your property, please call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage.

We have managed to get power restored to 70 properties, so currently 204 properties are still affected by a faulty underground cable.\n\nWe are still aiming to have the power back on between 04:30 and 05:30. If your power is back on now, please follow this link https://bit.ly/348KOZ3 to stop SMS updates.\n\nI'm sorry for the continued disruption, but I'll keep you informed with news from site.
