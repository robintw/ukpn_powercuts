Once completed, these works will enable the generator to be disconnected to restore our network to normal running conditions, improve the reliability of your power and will reduce the risk of you having a unplanned power cut in the future. To provide additional support to affected customers, we will have a customer champion on site for face to face support and battery packs to power some equipment such as charging mobile phones if needed.

Our engineers have now been able to make repairs tot he damage after work had to be temporarily halted due to a gas leak.\n\nWe know that a power cut can be difficult, and I'm sorry for the length of the time you were without your electricity. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on. If your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

        "Comment": "Sent by Bev at 00:45 - We believe our engineers have been able to restore power to all 6318 customers in the New Romney area, by diverting power around an overhead/ cable fault. We understand how difficult a power cut can be, we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.\n",

        "Comment": "Our staff have now arrived on site in the Hornsey Road area. They will start running tests at our substation to see how the local network is operating.\n\nIt's quite common for power to be restored briefly and go off again; this is our engineers using testing equipment to energise different sections of our network - this helps to narrow down any possible issues.\n\nOur cabling network is often broken down by smaller sites, and our staff may also check these to test for any problems, and they may also walk the cabling route to see if there are any signs of malfunction that have appeared on the surface. Our time frame hasn't been adjusted, so for now I'll let you know more news as soon as our staff update us.\n\nSent by Theo at 08:12.",

Our engineers have turned off the power in the King's Lynn PE32 area in the interest of the public's health and safety. This is so they can investigate reports of a low overhead line. We initially turned the power off to 1081 properties, however, we've managed to remotely divert power around the fault and get 250 of those properties back on.\n\nIf in the area, please take care and stay at least 10m away from the cable. \n\nOur engineers are estimating to have the power back on between 11:00 and 12:00, however, this may change. We'll keep you updated with our progress, but in the meantime our team are always here to talk on 105 if you have any questions or concerns.",

Thanks for your patience today, our field staff and control room engineers are working to get your power back on as quickly as they can.\n\nOur records show that some properties affected by today's power cut may have had other unexpected interruptions recently. If you have, we're sorry for further disruption. All power cuts are fully investigated by our engineers but can sometimes happen multiple times before we can safely find the issue and fix it.\n\nWe know that not everyone affected by today's power cut will have had other power cuts recently, but we want you to know that if you have, our customer services team will try to update as many customers as possible about our investigations.",

We have already sent staff to the area, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting the electricity around the faulty section. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will locate and repair the issue, which will take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",

Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 12:30 and 13:30, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?
