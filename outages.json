Our estimated time to have your power back on is between 15:30 and 16:30, however, this may need to change later depending on how our works progress.\n\nIf you'd like more information about why we sometimes have to switch power off to work; here's a short video https://bit.ly/3cYez0V.

This means we have been able to restore power sooner than we anticipated, we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.  \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.\n",

By doing this, we've managed to restore power to 1207 customers. There are now 465 properties still affected and using an average time frame we're estimating all power will be on between 15:00 and 16:00, but this may change later depending on what our staff find.\n\nWe'll keep sending SMS updates until everybody is restored.

We're arranging staff to attend ASAP, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting electricity. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to get as many customers back on as we can.\n\nOnce available, our engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, they will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will work to locate the issue and make repairs, which may take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing but we'll always give you the clearest information we have.",

Thanks for bearing with us during the power cut, I know the lights being off is a worry.\n\nOur staff have advised that repairs to the fault are progressing, however it's taking longer than expected. Due to this, they've advised a new time of 01:30-02:30 to have your power back on.\n\nI know another delay is frustrating; our engineers always try to give us the best estimate that they can but due to the safety elements of working with live electricity, sometimes they have to adjust their repairs at short notice.\n\nI'm sorry if this has caused you to change any plans you've made, but we'll be here to update you until the lights are safely back on.",

There are now only 3 properties without power, who we'll speak to directly. If you're without power and haven't been contacted, then we'll need to hear from you. Please call us on 08003163105 (free from landlines and mobiles).\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the unexpected outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",

Our engineers had to unexpectedly turn off the power to 15 customers in the Norwich NR9 3 area to safely repair a fault on the overhead network.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

They may also walk our cabling route throughout the area to check for any visible problems, check smaller electrical sites in the area, or apply specialist equipment which may restore power temporarily to help them with their testing.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nWe'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",

Following the results of their tests, the underground cable fault we believe is causing these issues has not yet become visible, so for the moment we have restored your power as fast as possible.\n\nI'm very sorry for the continued disruption, but this may happen again before we're able to fix it.
