Our contractors have advised us that the 6 affected properties will be restored early by approximately 11:45. This is because they are able to complete the remainder of the works with the power switched on. We can confirm that the works to replace and upgrade 3 poles on Cheddington Road will be completed which will improve the reliability of the network and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut in the future. Our reference number for this work is INCD-105534-C. I hope that the power coming on earlier is of benefit to you. We always aim to provide a 10/10 service, if you feel we have not delivered you a 10/10 service then please call us on 105.",

Doing this will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut in the future as we appreciate your area has been impacted by unplanned power cuts.To complete the work safely, we need to turn your power off to upgrade the poles and remove the existing transformer and install a new one on the same day. To ensure the power is off for the shortest possible time, our contractors Avidety may carry out preparation works prior to the power cut. This work is taking place in and around Buckland Road.",

They have investigated the grounded cable, and have deemed it safe to restore power back to all but 2 properties in the IP10 0 and IP11 0 area.\n\nWe're very sorry we had to turn your power off unexpectedly, and with so little warning. We usually provide much more notice if we can, but in a situation like this our first priority is the safety of the public and our staff.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. If your power is still off or if you have any questions, call our team on 08003163105.",

We're arranging staff to attend ASAP, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting electricity. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to get as many customers back on as we can.\n\nOnce available, our engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, they will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will work to locate the issue and make repairs, which may take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing but we'll always give you the clearest information we have.",

        "Comment": "Sent by Simon at 06:45 - We believe our engineers have been able to restore power to all 2139 customers in the SW10 and SW3 area, by diverting power around an underground cable fault. We understand how difficult a power cut can be, we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.",

I'll be on hand to update you as our staff work on repairs, and I just wanted to give you the latest from site.\n\nOur staff have been in contact with us and advised they need assistance from further staff. They are working to check smaller sites along our network, known as link boxes. These have very heavy metal lids, and for safety our engineer needs further staff to help.\n\nOur estimated time frame of 15:00-16:00 hasn't changed. I'll let you know more news as soon as our staff update us.",

        "Comment": "Sent by Theo at 10:59 - I'm texting to say I am glad to report that power to the Lucerne Drive area should now be back on.\n\nI'm sorry for the continued disruption recently. We believe there may be a fault on our underground electricity cabling in the area, but currently it has not developed to a stage that our staff can pinpoint it. Their tests have proven inconclusive, so for now they have replaced our safety equipment at the substation to get your power back on as quickly as possible.\n\nThis may happen again before we're able to fix it, but if you'd like to talk to us about this, or if your power isn't on call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

I know having power cuts as often as this must be very disruptive, and our staff are doing everything they can to get this resolved.\n\nThey are still testing our network in the area, and depending on the local infrastructure this can take some time. However, once they update us we'll know if our estimated time frame needs to change and why, and I'll let you know as soon as we hear.\n\nIn the meantime, if we can offer any support or advice, our team are always available to talk on 105.\n\nSent by Theo at 10:17.",
