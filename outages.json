        "Comment": "Sent by Decasta at 13:41 - We're pleased to report that all power in the Abbey Road area should now be restored. The local council sent out their electrician due to a water leak and following their safety checks, our engineers have connected a temporary generator. This will be providing your power while the council electrician completes internal work within the block of flats.\n\nDepending on what the issue is, it may take a few days for their repairs to be carried out, but once this is completed safely, the generator can be removed and network power will be resumed.\n\nIf you'd like any further information, or if your power is not restored, please call us any time on 08003163105.",

We've just had a shift change, so Decasta, Stuart, David and Adam are now here to keep you updated with progress from our field teams.\n\nJust a quick recap on what's happened during the power cut so far. Our engineers are waiting for an electrician from the local council to carryout safety checks due to a water leak within the block of flats in the Abbey Road area. \n\nOnce the electrician confirms the internal electrical equipment is safe, our engineers will then continue with their work to restore the power. If your power is back on, please follow this link https://bit.ly/348KOZ3 to stop SMS updates.\n\nI'm sorry for the continued disruption, but I'll keep you informed with news from site.

Due to this, they are not comfortable replacing the blown network equipment until the electrical equipment of the block of flats has been checked and deemed safe by a private electrician.\n\nWe are speaking with the local council and advising them of what needs to be done. Until this work has been carried out, our engineers won't be able to carry out any further work. You may not receive any further updates from us for a while now but as soon as we have been given the all clear, we will let you know. Sent by Will at 20:37",

However, once they've assessed further we'll let you know if the time frame needs to change.\n\nFor more information about this type of fault; here's a short video https://bit.ly/2ScxQDZ - I'll keep you updated.",
