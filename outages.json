Our contractors have advised that unfortunately there is going to be a delay in restoring your power. This is due to unforeseen access issues on site which has slowed down the progression of the works. We now estimate to restore your power between approximately 15:00 and 16:00. Please note that this is an estimated time frame and that your power may come on sooner. Our reference number for this work is INCD-327202-U. We would like to apologise for any inconvenience this may cause you and thank you for your patience. If you have any questions or you have moved from the RH13 postcode area, then please give us a call on 105. VB & SMS sent.",

For now we have restored your power as quickly as we can.\n\nIf your power isn't on or you would like to talk to us, call us for free on 08003163105. We know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",

Our estimated time frame is currently between 22:30 and 23:30, although as we mentioned previously this can be subject to change.\n\nWe're keeping in touch with our staff regularly to make sure you have the best information to plan ahead.

        "Comment": "Sent by Simon at 12:46 - We can now confirm that all power in the Uckfield TN22 area should be back on. Our engineers have diverted power around the underground network fault to get the majority of customers back on. However, due to the location and complexity of the issue, we have also used a temporary generator to restore power to the last of the affected properties. This will provide power until our engineers plan in and safely complete the full repair, which may take a few days.\n\nWe're really sorry for any disruption this unexpected power cut caused. If your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n",

Added to this, heavy rain can make it difficult to travel and access our equipment.\n\nWe want to get your power back on as quickly as we can, but the safety of our staff and customers is always our first priority, so we sometimes have to wait until the weather has improved before repairs can begin.\n\nMy team and I will continue to keep you updated.",

We know your power may have been off for a long time, so we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.",

        "Comment": "Sent by Theo at 11:24 - Just another check in from us, as we know power being off for longer periods can be very disruptive, and we just wanted to help explain why it can take longer to get power restored safely during bad weather like we're having at the moment.\n\nWith high winds, our engineers cannot safely do some of the things they need to, such as climb electricity poles. Added to this, heavy rain can make it difficult to travel and access our equipment.\n\nWe want to get your power back on as quickly as we can, but the safety of our staff and customers is always our first priority, so we sometimes have to wait until the weather has improved before repairs can begin.\n\nMy team and I will continue to keep you updated.",

Our engineers had to unexpectedly turn off the power to 206 customers in the Bentley, IP9 2 area to safely repair a fault on our overhead cabling network.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

We've had an update from our staff that there are now 136 properties still affected by the faulty overhead electrical equipment, as they have managed to safely divert some power, getting the lights back on for 1586 of our customers.\n\nWe'll keep sending text updates to everyone until all the power to your area is on.

        "Comment": "Sent by David at 12:00 - Hi David here from the messaging team. We're very sorry we've had to switch off your electricity.\n\nOur engineers have turned off the power in the Downham Market area for safety so they can repair a faulty piece of overhead electrical equipment. Our estimated time to have your power back on is between 13:30 and 14:30, however, this may need to change later depending on how our works progress.\n\nIf you'd like more information about why we sometimes have to switch power off to work; here's a short video https://bit.ly/3cYez0V. We'll keep you updated with progress.",

Due to there being multiple power cuts over a short space of time, our engineers are going to be testing if the network is still healthy.\n\nThey will start at the substation, and often apply specialist equipment that may turn your power back on for a brief period, so don't worry if your power comes on and goes off again. They will also check smaller sites which run along our cabling route, these break our network down into smaller sections and can help pinpoint any possible problems.\n\nOur estimated time frame of 17:30-18:30 hasn't changed, so I'll let you know more once our staff update us.

For now we have restored your power as quickly as we can.\n\nIf your power isn't on or you would like to talk to us, call us for free on 08003163105.

They may also walk our cabling route throughout the area to check for any visible problems, check smaller electrical sites in the area, or apply specialist equipment which may restore power temporarily to help them with their testing.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nWe'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",

For now we have restored your power as quickly as we can.\n\nIf your power isn't on or you would like to talk to us, call us for free on 08003163105. We know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",

For now we have restored your power as quickly as we can.\n\nIf your power isn't on or you would like to talk to us, call us for free on 08003163105.

We have already sent staff to the area, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting the electricity around the faulty section. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will locate and repair the issue, which will take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",

At this point we think the issue is an overhead cable fault affecting 153 properties.\n\nSpecialist engineers from our control room are also working to divert power remotely, so it's possible your power could come back on at any point. We can't always restore everyone this way. That's why we're also sending staff to the area to check our equipment.\n\nEvery fault is different, so our time frames have to be estimated but currently we hope to have power back on between 23:00 and 00:00. We must stress that it may become necessary for this to change, depending on what our engineers find.\n\nWe'll keep you updated with our progress.",
