The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",

        "Comment": "Sent by Bev at 22:26 - Engineers are on their way. At this point we think the issue is a fault with equipment in your local substation in the Penrose Street area. We didn't know this was going to happen, so time frames we provide throughout are estimated and are subject to change.\n\nOur estimated time to have power back on is currently between 02:00 and 03:00, but after we arrive and assess the situation this may change. The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",

Our team of cable jointers have now identified the suspected section of faulted underground cabling using their specialist equipment.\n\nOur digging team will now begin excavations, and this can take some time depending on the surface material, and how much space is needed to allow our engineers to assess the fault and make their repairs safely. \n\nOur estimated time frame of 16:00-17:00 doesn't need to change currently. We'll continue to keep you updated, but our team are always here if you have any questions.",

        "Comment": "Hi, Decasta from the messaging team here; just a quick recap on what's happened during the power cut so far. Our engineers are still onsite in the Belmont Street area. They have been in touch to let us know that there is a lot of water in the excavation site, so it's making it difficult to locate the cabling fault. You may now notice traffic management in the area, this is to allow engineers to carryout their work safely.\n\nWe are still aiming to have the power back on between 11:00-12:00. If your power is back on now, please follow this link https://bit.ly/348KOZ3 to stop SMS updates.\n\nI'm sorry for the continued disruption, but I'll keep you informed with news from site. If you have any concerns, please call us on 08003163105.",

The issue was caused by an unexpected fault with some of our network equipment, which our engineers have now replaced.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

They may also walk our cabling route throughout the area to check for any visible problems, check smaller electrical sites in the area, or apply specialist equipment which may restore power temporarily to help them with their testing.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nWe'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",

They have diverted power around an underground cable fault.\n\nWe know some properties in the area may have faced other recent interruptions, and we're sorry for the extra disruption. Every outage is fully investigated by our engineers, though power may be lost several times before we can safely find and fix the issue. Our customer services team will keep as many customers updated as possible during these investigations. \n\nWe're sorry for the unplanned disruption.

We have already sent staff to the area, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting the electricity around the faulty section. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will locate and repair the issue, which will take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",

In order to continue their works on the damaged cabling safely, they have had to turn off power to further properties in the area. \n\nWe're sending specialist teams and equipment to site, and it's possible they will still be able to restore your power within the current time frame of 14:30-15:30 using other methods. However, once they've assessed further we'll let you know if the time frame needs to change.\n\nIf you'd like more information about why we sometimes have to switch power off to work; here's a short video https://bit.ly/3cYez0V.
