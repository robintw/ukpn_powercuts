To allow time for us to get the generators out to your area and connect them, we're now estimating we'll have power back on between 13:30 and 14:30.\n\nWe're sorry to change the time frame and will let you know when they arrive.",

Specialist engineers are also working to divert power remotely, and this can cause your lights to go on and off. We know that a power cut can be very disruptive; we understand this can greatly impact your daily activities and we want to support you however we can. We'll update you with all of our progress but if you need to speak to us, call our team on 08003163105 any time. Sent by Kevin at 10:22.",

This can make it difficult to locate, so while our engineers are testing our equipment thoroughly to pinpoint the issue, this kind of problem may interrupt power multiple times before it's possible for us to fix.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nI'll keep you updated. Sent by Stuart at 00:11.",
