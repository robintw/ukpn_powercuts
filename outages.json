        "Comment": "Good morning, this is a message from Ryan at UK Power Networks regarding the planned power cut that is scheduled for today the 3rd of February 2026 in the IP25 postcode area. Our engineers have advised us that unfortunately there is going to be a delay in the power being switched off. This is due to safety checks within some properties and on the network taking longer than expected. We now estimate to switch off power to the area in stages by approximately 10:00. Our reference number for this work is INCD-17281-I. We would like to apologise for any inconvenience this may cause you. If you have any questions or you have moved from the IP25 postcode area, then please call 105.",

Our engineers have now safely connected a temporary generator, and this will be providing your power while our engineers work to fully repair the unexpected fault on the underground electrical network.\n\nDepending on what the issue is, it may take a few days for our engineers to plan in the work and make their repairs, but once this is completed safely the generator can be removed, and network power will be resumed.\n\nIf you'd like any further information, or if your power is not restored, please call us any time on 08003163105.",

Thanks for your patience today, our field staff and control room engineers are working to get your power back on as quickly as they can.\n\nOur records show that some properties affected by today's power cut may have had other unexpected interruptions recently. If you have, we're sorry for further disruption. All power cuts are fully investigated by our engineers but can sometimes happen multiple times before we can safely find the issue and fix it.\n\nWe know that not everyone affected by today's power cut will have had other power cuts recently, but we want you to know that if you have, our customer services team will try to update as many customers as possible about our investigations.",

        "Comment": "Sent by Theo at 03:51 - We're sorry your power has gone off again today. We believed all power was restored but our staff have confirmed that our substation equipment has operated repeatedly due to an underground cable fault which we'll need to pinpoint, excavate and repair.\n\nWe're sending specialist teams and equipment to site, and it's possible they will still be able to restore your power within the current time frame of 06:00-07:00 using other methods. However, once they've assessed further we'll let you know if the time frame needs to change.\n\nFor more information about this type of fault; here's a short video https://bit.ly/2ScxQDZ - I'll keep you updated.",
