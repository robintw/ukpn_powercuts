Thanks for bearing with us during the power cut, I know the lights being off is a worry.\n\nOur staff have advised that that the repair work is proving to be more complex than previously anticipated and as a result, we may need to turn off more power to enable safe repairs. Due to the delay this has caused, they've advised a new time of 01:00-02:00 to have your power back on.\n\nI know another delay is frustrating; our engineers always try to give us the best estimate that they can but due to the safety elements of working with live electricity, sometimes they have to adjust their repairs at short notice.\n",

We can now confirm that the issue is a fault on our underground electricity cabling and there are 2 properties affected, which we'll speak to directly. If you're without power and haven't been contacted, then we'll need to hear from you. Please call us on 08003163105 (free from landlines and mobiles).\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the unexpected outage.

We didn't know this was going to happen, so time frames we provide throughout are estimated and are subject to change.\n\nOur estimated time to have power back on is currently between 23:30 and 00:30, but after we arrive and assess the situation this may change. The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",

We appreciate it can be unsettling to have a power cut during the night, but our engineers work 24 hours on issues like this so we're still aiming to have power restored as soon as possible.\n\nIf you light candles, please be mindful of them and take extra care when using the stairs. If you have any concerns, please call us on 105 and our team will help. We'll keep you updated. Sent by Aaron at 02:46",

This will allow them to cut our cable, and using specialist equipment, test each side to help narrow down where the fault lies.\n\nOur estimated time frame doesn't need to change currently, and we'll continue to keep you updated, but our team are always here on 08003163105 from any phone if you have any questions.

For now we have restored your power as quickly as we can.\n\nIf your power isn't on or you would like to talk to us, call us for free on 08003163105. We know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",

However, this could change once our staff have assessed the local network.\n\nWe believe the power cuts you have been experiencing are caused by a fault with one of the cables. Developing faults can start very small, and so can be hard to detect but each power cut usually makes it easier to see, which means our specialist staff can detect it, and work on the repair to prevent further outages.\n\nI'll let you know once our teams arrive.",

We have already sent staff to the area, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting the electricity around the faulty section. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there.

This means we have been able to restore power sooner than we anticipated, we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.\n\n\n\n",

We have already sent staff to the area, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting the electricity around the faulty section. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will locate and repair the issue, which will take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",

We believe the issue is an underground network fault that initially interrupted power to 1335 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 141 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 05:00-06:00, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

The issue was due to a faulty piece of underground  electrical equipment, however engineers have managed to restore power from the substation nearby and will be investigating the root cause.\n\nIf there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the unexpected outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",

However, once they've assessed further we'll let you know if the time frame needs to change.\n\nFor more information about this type of fault; here's a short video https://bit.ly/2ScxQDZ - I'll keep you updated.",
