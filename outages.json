We apologise that we had to change our time for restoration during the power cut, and we appreciate your understanding.\n\nIf your power isn't back on, we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nSent by Theo at 14:14",

Our staff are working hard to get you back on, and I just wanted to give you the latest from them.\n\nOur engineers have now managed to safely restore power via temporary generators to most of the affected properties, and have advised that only 4 customers are still without power.\n\nIf your power is back on now, you can stop SMS updates on our website here - https://bit.ly/348KOZ3.

Please accept our sincere apology as we know that it is difficult to be without power for a longer duration.\n\nIf your power isn't back on, we'll need to hear from you. To talk to us about this or anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles. We're really sorry for any disruption this caused.",

Today's power cut was an unexpected underground cable fault that affected 2053 properties, so I'm sorry that we weren't able to provide you with prior notice. I'm pleased to report our staff have resolved this by diverting power to get your lights back on as soon as possible.\n\nWe contact customers when we are made aware of problems like this, so if you would like to be notified in future let us know here https://bit.ly/3zyHC6L\n\nI personally apologise for the disruption this caused you. We aim to provide a 10/10 service in keeping you updated, so if you'd like to talk to us about anything or are still without power, please call us on 105.",

This means we have been able to restore power sooner than we anticipated, we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.\n\n\n\n",

We believe the issue is an underground network fault that initially interrupted power to 2053 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 28 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 17:30-18:30, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

Today's power cut was an unexpected underground cable fault that affected 2368 properties, so I'm sorry that we weren't able to provide you with prior notice.

Our staff are working as quickly as they can to get the lights back on, and they've advised us that there are now 49 properties still affected.\n\nThey have managed to get a further 169 of our customers back on by diverting electricity, so your power may have come on sooner than we originally advised.\n\nIf you're still off, please don't worry; work on the issue will continue along with SMS updates until everyone is back on.\n\nTo stop receiving texts, just follow this link https://bit.ly/348KOZ3 to unsubscribe.",

We have already sent staff to the area, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting the electricity around the faulty section. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will locate and repair the issue, which will take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",

We believe there may be a fault on our underground electricity cabling in the area, but currently it has not developed to a stage that our staff can pinpoint it. Their tests have proven inconclusive, so for now they have replaced our safety equipment at the substation to get your power back on as quickly as possible.\n\nThis may happen again before we're able to fix it, but if you'd like to talk to us about this, or if your power isn't on call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

We want to be as transparent as possible as we know having multiple power cuts is disruptive and worrying, so I would like to help explain why we can't always fix a problem like this right away.\n\nUnderground electricity cabling is insulated for safety and if a fault develops, these materials can re-seal due to heat passing through them when our safety equipment operates and your power is lost. This covers any potential fault again, meaning our staff cannot locate it using their tests or specialist equipment.\n\nWe'll know more once our staff contact us again, so I'll be in touch again shortly.\n\nSent by Stuart at 17:33.",

        "Comment": "Our staff have now arrived on site in the Luncies Road area. Due to there being multiple power cuts over a short space of time, our engineers are going to be testing if the network is still healthy.\n\nThey will start at the substation, and often apply specialist equipment that may turn your power back on for a brief period, so don't worry if your power comes on and goes off again. They will also check smaller sites which run along our cabling route, these break our network down into smaller sections and can help pinpoint any possible problems.\n\nOur estimated time frame of 20:30-21:30 hasn't changed, so I'll let you know more once our staff update us.

For now we have restored your power as quickly as we can.\n\nIf your power isn't on or you would like to talk to us, call us for free on 08003163105.

They may also walk our cabling route throughout the area to check for any visible problems, check smaller electrical sites in the area, or apply specialist equipment which may restore power temporarily to help them with their testing.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nWe'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",

Today's power cut was an unexpected underground cable fault that affected several thousand properties, so I'm sorry that we weren't able to provide you with prior notice. I'm pleased to report our staff have resolved this by diverting power to get your lights back on as soon as possible.\n\nWe contact customers when we are made aware of problems like this, so if you would like to be notified in future let us know here https://bit.ly/3zyHC6L\n\nI personally apologise for the disruption this caused you.

We're pleased that we have been able to restore power sooner than we estimated.\n\nIf your power isn't back on, we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on.
