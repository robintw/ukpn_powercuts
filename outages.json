The issue was caused by an unexpected underground cable fault, which our engineers repaired.\n\nWe know that a power cut can be difficult, and I'm sorry for the length of the time you were without your electricity. Please rest assured that our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

Thanks for bearing with us during the power cut, I know the lights being off is a worry.\n\nOur staff have advised that that the repair work is proving to be more complex than previously anticipated and as a result, we may need to turn off more power to enable safe repairs. Due to the delay this has caused, they've advised a new time of 01:00-02:00 to have your power back on.\n\nI know another delay is frustrating; our engineers always try to give us the best estimate that they can but due to the safety elements of working with live electricity, sometimes they have to adjust their repairs at short notice.\n",

Excavations can sometimes take longer than expected, depending on ground conditions, other utility equipment like gas and water pipes, parked vehicles, or local traffic. We have restored some properties which leaves 15 still currently off.\n\nAt the moment our estimated time frame of 17:30 - 18:30 hasn't changed, but as our staff are busy working with live electricity we need to wait until they can safely stop work and contact us with the latest information. Once they do, we'll update you further.\n\nOur team are always here if you have any questions.",

Our engineers have cleared the trees from the overhead network that was causing the issue and have been able to restore power.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage.

        "Comment": "Our staff have now arrived on site in the Wykeham Street area. They will start running tests at our substation to see how the local network is operating.\n\nIt's quite common for power to be restored briefly and go off again; this is our engineers using testing equipment to energise different sections of our network - this helps to narrow down any possible issues.\n\nOur cabling network is often broken down by smaller sites, and our staff may also check these to test for any problems, and they may also walk the cabling route to see if there are any signs of malfunction that have appeared on the surface. Our time frame hasn't been adjusted, so for now I'll let you know more news as soon as our staff update us.\n\nSent by Kevin at 08:21.",
