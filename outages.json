This has identified trees that have grown close, which could damage the cables and affect your electricity supply. Our engineers need to temporarily switch off your power so we can safely cut the trees away from the cables. Doing this will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut in the future as we appreciate you may have been impacted by an unplanned power cut in the last 6 months. This work is taking place near Whitmoor Common. A road closure will be in place along Whitmoor Lane to allow this work to be carried out safely.",

We appreciate this is an added concern, so we want to provide some advice for anyone in this situation.\n\nYou can use your phone as a personal hotspot to keep an internet connection (be aware of the data limit your network provider allows for this), use a battery pack to keep your devices charged and adjust the power settings on any laptops or mobile devices to extend their lifespan. As it's quite common for your immediate neighbours to remain on power during an issue like this, ask to see if they can share access to their Wi-Fi network temporarily.\n\nWe'll keep you updated.",

        "Comment": "Sent by Aiden at 11:29 - We can now confirm that all power in the St Johns Road area should be back on. The issue was caused by an unexpected fault with some of our network equipment, which our engineers have now replaced.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

This means we have been able to restore power sooner than we anticipated, we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.\n\n",

However, once they've assessed further we'll let you know if the time frame needs to change.\n\nFor more information about this type of fault; here's a short video https://bit.ly/2ScxQDZ - I'll keep you updated.",
