Thanks for your patience today, our field staff and control room engineers are working to get your power back on as quickly as they can.\n\nOur records show that some properties affected by today's power cut may have had other unexpected interruptions recently. If you have, we're sorry for further disruption. All power cuts are fully investigated by our engineers but can sometimes happen multiple times before we can safely find the issue and fix it.\n\nWe know that not everyone affected by today's power cut will have had other power cuts recently, but we want you to know that if you have, our customer services team will try to update as many customers as possible about our investigations.",

Please accept our sincere apology as we know that it is difficult to be without power for a longer duration.\n\nIf your power isn't back on, we'll need to hear from you. To talk to us about this or anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles. We're really sorry for any disruption this caused.",

        "Comment": "Our staff have now arrived on site in the St. Clements Close area. Due to there being multiple power cuts over a short space of time, our engineers are going to start their tests at the nearby substation.\n\nOur current time frame is between 05:00 and 06:00; this is an estimate based on them checking the state of our network, and attempting to restore your power.\n\nIt's possible that the underground cabling fault we believe has been causing these power cuts has reach a point where they can't safely replace our substation equipment. If this happens we'll need to arrange further teams and equipment, so I'll let you know more news as soon as our staff update us. Sent by Adam at 03:13.",
