        "Comment": "Hi, just an update from Lisa at 13:06. Thanks for bearing with us today. Our staff are working hard to get you back on, and I just wanted to give you the latest from them.\n\nOur engineers have now managed to safely restore power via temporary generators to most of the affected properties, and have advised that only 4 customers are still without power.\n\nIf your power is back on now, you can stop SMS updates on our website here - https://bit.ly/348KOZ3. Otherwise, we're sorry your lights are still off; our estimated time frame of 13:00 and 14:00 hasn't changed and I'll continue to keep you updated.",

We have now restored power to all but one property. We're sorry for any disruption this unexpected power cut caused.\n\nIf your power isn't back on, we'd still like to keep you updated. If we aren't currently in contact with you by phone or in person at your property, please call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",

Please only attempt this if you are confident it can be done safely.\n\nIf you have someone in the property who may be more vulnerable to the cold please do not hesitate to call us free on 105.\n\nWe will do our best to provide additional care and support whilst work continues to get your power back on ASAP.",

We know power may have been off for a long time; we're sorry for any disruption this unplanned power cut caused.  \n\nWe know some properties in the area may have faced other recent interruptions, and we're sorry for the extra disruption. Every outage is fully investigated by our engineers, though power may be lost several times before we can safely find and fix the issue. Our customer services team will keep as many customers updated as possible during these investigations.\n\nTo talk to us, or let us know that your power isn't restored, call us on 08003163105.",

Thanks for your patience today, our field staff and control room engineers have worked to get your power back on as quickly as they can.\n\nOur records show that some properties affected by today's power cut may have had other unexpected interruptions recently. If you have, we're sorry for further disruption. All power cuts are fully investigated by our engineers but can sometimes happen multiple times before we can safely find the issue and fix it.\n\nWe know that not everyone affected by today's power cut will have had other power cuts recently, but we want you to know that if you have, our customer services team will try to update as many customers as possible about our investigations.",

Today's power cut was an unexpected overhead cable fault that affected 1735 properties, so I'm sorry that we weren't able to provide you with prior notice. I'm pleased to report our staff have resolved this by diverting power to get your lights back on as soon as possible.\n\nWe contact customers when we are made aware of problems like this, so if you would like to be notified in future let us know here https://bit.ly/3zyHC6L\n\nI personally apologise for the disruption this caused you. We aim to provide a 10/10 service in keeping you updated, so if you'd like to talk to us about anything or are still without power, please call us on 105.",

We're arranging staff to attend ASAP, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting electricity. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to get as many customers back on as we can.\n\nOnce available, our engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, they will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will work to locate the issue and make repairs, which may take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing but we'll always give you the clearest information we have.",

Our engineers had to unexpectedly turn off the power to 78 customers in the PE38 0 area to safely repair an overhead cable on the ground.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

For now we have restored your power as quickly as we can.\n\nIf your power isn't on or you would like to talk to us, call us for free on 08003163105.

They will start running tests at our substation to see how the local network is operating.\n\nIt's quite common for power to be restored briefly and go off again; this is our engineers using testing equipment to energise different sections of our network - this helps to narrow down any possible issues.\n\nOur cabling network is often broken down by smaller sites, and our staff may also check these to test for any problems, and they may also walk the cabling route to see if there are any signs of malfunction that have appeared on the surface. Our time frame hasn't been adjusted, so for now I'll let you know more news as soon as our staff update us.\n\nSent by Theo at 18:38.",

The issue was caused by an unexpected fault with some of our network equipment, which our engineers have now replaced.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

They will then check our network equipment throughout the area to try and identify any problems, before trying to restore power.\n\nOur estimated time frame of 03:00 and 04:00 hasn't changed, but if this is not successful it's possible that a cable repair may be needed. This can involve ground excavations, traffic management equipment or specialist teams. As soon as our staff can safely update us, we'll give you the latest news. Sent by Lisa at 23:13.",

As there have been other power cuts recently it's difficult to know what repairs will be needed to restore your power safely, so time frames we provide throughout have to be estimated.\n\nThe results of our engineer's tests on our network will let us know if our estimate needs to be adjusted, so we'll update you as soon as they have arrived on site and investigated.",
