Our staff are working as quickly as they can to get the lights back on, and they've advised us that there are now 96 properties still affected.\n\nThey have managed to get a further 270 of our customers back on by diverting electricity, so your power may have come on sooner than we originally advised.\n\nIf you're still off, please don't worry; work on the issue will continue along with SMS updates until everyone is back on.\n\nTo stop receiving texts, just follow this link https://bit.ly/348KOZ3 to unsubscribe.",

        "Comment": "What will happen next?\n\nThis outage is affecting multiple areas, so locations we mention may be further away than you'd expect. We have already sent staff to the area, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting the electricity around the faulty section. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will locate and repair the issue, which will take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",

For now we have restored your power as quickly as we can.\n\nIf your power isn't on or you would like to talk to us, call us for free on 08003163105. We know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",

They will start running tests at our substation to see how the local network is operating.\n\nIt's quite common for power to be restored briefly and go off again; this is our engineers using testing equipment to energise different sections of our network - this helps to narrow down any possible issues.\n\nOur cabling network is often broken down by smaller sites, and our staff may also check these to test for any problems, and they may also walk the cabling route to see if there are any signs of malfunction that have appeared on the surface. Our time frame hasn't been adjusted, so for now I'll let you know more news as soon as our staff update us.\n\nSent by Bev at 07:26.",

Due to there being multiple power cuts over a short space of time, our engineers are going to start their tests at the nearby substation.\n\nOur current time frame is between 09:00 and 10:00; this is an estimate based on them checking the state of our network, and attempting to restore your power.\n\nIt's possible that the underground cabling fault we believe has been causing these power cuts has reach a point where they can't safely replace our substation equipment. If this happens we'll need to arrange further teams and equipment, so I'll let you know more news as soon as our staff update us. Sent by Bev at 06:54.",

The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",

We didn't know this was going to happen, so time frames we provide throughout are estimated and are subject to change.\n\nOur estimated time to have power back on is currently between 00:00 and 01:00, but after we arrive and assess the situation this may change. The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",

There are now only 3 properties without power, who we'll speak to directly. If you're without power and haven't been contacted, then we'll need to hear from you. Please call us on 08003163105 (free from landlines and mobiles).\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the unexpected outage.
