To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on.

As they do this, they will identify healthy sections of cable which we can attempt to use to divert power around the fault.\n\nOur estimated time frame of 02:30-03:30 hasn't changed. However, we have been able to divert more power to restore an additional 35 properties. I will personally be keeping an eye on this, and I'll continue to update you with further news.",

        "Comment": "Sent by Talie at 16:44 - Our engineers are on their way. We believe the issue is an underground cable fault that initially interrupted power to 3194 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 93 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 21:30-22:30, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

        "Comment": "What will happen next?\n\nThis outage is affecting multiple areas, so locations we mention may be further away than you'd expect. We have already sent staff to the area, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting the electricity around the faulty section. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will locate and repair the issue, which will take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",
