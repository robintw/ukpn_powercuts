Our staff are working as quickly as they can to get the lights back on, and they've advised us that there are now 31 properties still affected.\n\nThey have managed to get a further 51 of our customers back on by diverting electricity, so your power may have come on sooner than we originally advised.\n\nIf you're still off, please don't worry; work on the issue will continue along with SMS updates until everyone is back on.\n\nTo stop receiving texts, just follow this link https://bit.ly/348KOZ3 to unsubscribe.",

There are now 82 properties still affected.\n\nFor those still without power, there's going to be a lot of work required to repair the issue safely, so we have decided to use temporary generators to provide power. To allow time for us to get the generators out to your area and connect them, we're now estimating we'll have power back on between 22:30 and 23:30.\n\nWe're sorry to change the time frame and will let you know when they arrive.",

We didn't know this was going to happen, so time frames we provide throughout are estimated and are subject to change.\n\nOur estimated time to have power back on is currently between 15:30 and 16:30, but after we arrive and assess the situation this may change. The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",

Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.

Today's power cut was unexpected, so we were unable to provide you with prior notice to help you plan ahead. I am pleased to confirm that we managed to resolve this by diverting power to get your lights back on as soon as possible.\n\nJust so you know, we text customers when we are made aware of problems like this, so if you would like to be notified in the future you can do so here https://bit.ly/3zyHC6L.\n\nThis was a widespread problem on the overhead network and I personally apologise for any disruption this has caused to your day. If you have any questions or are still without power, please call us on 105.",

This means we have been able to restore power sooner than we anticipated, we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.",

In addition to this, they are liaising closely with our control room to find safe and reliable ways to divert power around any problems and get everyone restored.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them. We'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",

        "Comment": "Sent by Simon at 13:55 - We believe our engineers have been able to restore power to all 1241 customers in the Cobham KT11 3 area, by diverting power around an underground cable fault. This means we have been able to restore power sooner than we anticipated, we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.",

By doing this, we've managed to restore power to 168 customers. There are now 42 properties still affected and using an average time frame we're estimating all power will be on between15:30 and 16:30, but this may change later depending on what our staff find.\n\nWe'll keep sending SMS updates until everybody is restored.
