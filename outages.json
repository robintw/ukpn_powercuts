Our engineers have advised us that the 25 affected properties will be restored early at approximately 12:15 as the works have progressed quicker than expected. We can confirm that once power has been restored to the area that the works to replace and upgrade a piece of equipment called a transformer near Newsons farm will be completed which will improve the reliability of the network and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut in the future. Our reference number for this work is INCD-104869-C. I hope that the power coming on earlier is of benefit to you.

Our engineers have now safely connected temporary generators, and these will be providing your power while our engineers work to fully repair the unexpected overhead network fault.\n\nDepending on what the issue is, it may take a few days for our engineers to plan in the work and make their repairs, but once this is completed safely the generators can be removed, and network power will be resumed.\n\nIf you'd like any further information, or if your power is not restored, please call us any time on 08003163105.",

Our engineers had to unexpectedly turn off the power to safely repair an underground network fault in the Terrilands area.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

To keep everyone safe while we carry out these works, we will need to temporarily turn off your electricity. We are taking extra measures to limit the time your power is off and we'll do our best to cause as little disruption as possible. Doing this will improve the reliability of the electricity network in the future. This work is taking place near Debden Road and Chalk Farm Lane.",

This essential work helps to provide a reliable electricity supply to your property, reducing the risk of any unplanned power cuts in the future.

Our contractors have advised us that unfortunately there is going to be a delay in the power being switched off. This is due to an unforeseen issue with a piece of electrical equipment called a Linkbox which has delayed the works from commencing. We now estimate to switch off your power between approximately 10:00 and 10:30. Our reference number for this work is INCD-16177-I.

        "Comment": "Good morning, this is a message from Ryan at UK Power Networks regarding the planned power cut which is currently in progress today the 3rd of December 2025 in the MK17 postcode area. Our engineers have advised us that the 10 affected properties will be restored early at approximately 11:30 as they have had good access, so the works have progressed quicker than expected. We can confirm that once power has been restored to the area that the works to test a transformer near London Road will be completed which will improve the reliability of the network and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut in the future. Our reference number for this work is INCD-105468-C. I hope that the power coming on earlier is of benefit to you. We always aim to provide a 10/10 service, if you feel we have not delivered you a 10/10 service then please call us on 105.",
