Our engineers have advised that unfortunately there is going to be a delay in restoring your power. This is due to unforeseen issues on site which have delayed the progress of the works. We now estimate to restore your power between approximately 13:30 and 14:30. Please note that this is an estimated time frame and that your power may come on sooner. Our reference number for this work is INCD-327103-U. We would like to apologise for any inconvenience this may cause you.

For now we have restored your power as quickly as we can.\n\nIf your power isn't on or you would like to talk to us, call us for free on 08003163105. We know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",

To get your power back on today we have reconfigured the local electricity network. This in turn will both help pinpoint the issue and minimise further interruptions.\n\nIf you'd like more information on the issue, or if your power isn't back on, call us on 08003163105. We know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",

I know having power cuts as often as this must be very disruptive, and our staff are doing everything they can to get this resolved.\n\nThey are still testing our network in the area, and depending on the local infrastructure this can take some time. However, once they update us we'll know if our estimated time frame needs to change and why, and I'll let you know as soon as we hear.\n\nIn the meantime, if we can offer any support or advice, our team are always available to talk on 105.\n\nSent by David at 09:04.",

Our engineers have advised they now believe another company has damaged our overhead electrical cables which has resulted in the loss of power in the ME9 7 area. They are investigating this now and will wok to restore power as soon as its safely possible. At the moment we don't need to change the estimated timeframe.\n\nWe're sorry for the disruption this power cut may be causing. If you're worried about elderly or ill neighbours, we can offer help and support to our vulnerable customers during a power cut. Find out more here: https://bit.ly/40quttu.\n\nIf you have any concerns, please call us on 08003163105",

Our engineers have turned off the power in the CT2 0, CT3 4, CT6 7 area in the interest of the public's health and safety. This is so they can investigate reports of a low overhead line..\n\nIf in the area, please take care and stay at least 10m away from the cable. \n\nHowever, based on an average for this kind of issue, our estimated time to have you back on is between 15:30-16:30. \n\nWe'll keep you updated with our progress, but in the meantime our team are always here to talk on 105 if you have any questions or concerns.",
