For now we have restored your power as quickly as we can.\n\nIf your power isn't on or you would like to talk to us, call us for free on 08003163105. We know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",

We believe the issue is an underground cable fault that initially interrupted power to 1002 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so eight properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 00:00-01:00, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?
