They have diverted power around an overhead cable fault.\n\nWe know some properties in the area may have faced other recent interruptions, and we're sorry for the extra disruption. Every outage is fully investigated by our engineers, though power may be lost several times before we can safely find and fix the issue. Our customer services team will keep as many customers updated as possible during these investigations. \n\nWe're sorry for the unplanned disruption. If you need to talk to us, or let us know that your power isn't restored, call us on 08003163105.\n",

This means we have been able to restore power sooner than we anticipated, however we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on.

We have already sent staff to the area, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting the electricity around the faulty section. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will locate and repair the issue, which will take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",

We believe the issue is an overhead cable fault that initially interrupted power to 887 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 31 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 11:00-12:00, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?
