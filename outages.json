Our contractors have advised us that unfortunately there is going to be a delay in the power being switched off. This is due to the generator leads being stolen, meaning that new leads are required before the works can commence. At the moment we do not have an estimated time for the new equipment to be delivered, rest assured we will keep you informed with any updates. Our reference number for this work is INCD-23787-O. We would like to apologise for any inconvenience this may cause you. If you have any questions or you have moved from the CO5 postcode area, then please give us a call on 105.",

Thanks for bearing with us during the power cut, I know the lights being off is a worry.\n\nOur staff have advised that they have restored power to some properties but still have a lot of work to do to complete repairs to the underground network. Due to the delay this has caused, they've advised a new time of between 14:00 and 15:00 to have your power back on.\n\nI know another delay is frustrating; our engineers always try to give us the best estimate that they can but due to the safety elements of working with live electricity, sometimes they have to adjust their repairs at short notice.\n\nI'm sorry if this has caused you to change any plans you've made, but we'll be here to update you until the lights are  back on.",

        "Comment": "Sent by Bev at 06:09 - Our engineers are on their way. We believe the issue is an underground cable fault that initially interrupted power to 1993 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 426 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 07:30-08:30, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

A further 30 properties have now been restored.\n\nOur records show that some properties affected by today's power cut may have had other unexpected interruptions recently. If you have, we're sorry for further disruption. All power cuts are fully investigated by our engineers but can sometimes happen multiple times before we can safely find the issue and fix it.\n\nWe know that not everyone affected by today's power cut will have had other power cuts recently, but we want you to know that if you have, our team will try to update as many customers as possible about our investigations.",

We believe the issue is on our overhead network which initially interrupted power to 1305 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 183 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 10:30 and 11:30, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

We're arranging staff to attend ASAP, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting electricity. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to get as many customers back on as we can.\n\nOnce available, our engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, they will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will work to locate the issue and make repairs, which may take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing but we'll always give you the clearest information we have.",

Thanks for your patience today, our field staff and control room engineers have worked to get your power back on as quickly as they can.\n\nOur records show that some properties affected by today's power cut may have had other unexpected interruptions recently. If you have, we're sorry for further disruption. All power cuts are fully investigated by our engineers but can sometimes happen multiple times before we can safely find the issue and fix it.\n\nWe know that not everyone affected by today's power cut will have had other power cuts recently, but we want you to know that if you have, our customer services team will try to update as many customers as possible about our investigations.",

This means we have been able to restore power sooner than we anticipated , we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.",

By doing this, we've managed to restore power to a further 121 customers. There are now 665 properties still affected.\n\nWe'll keep sending SMS updates until everybody is restored.

We believe the issue is underground fault that initially interrupted power to 1384 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 786 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between *13:00 and 14:00, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

This means we have been able to restore power sooner than we anticipated, we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.",
