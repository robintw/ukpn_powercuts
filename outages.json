This has identified 21 electricity poles that need upgrading. Doing this will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut in the future. Our contractors Avidety may carry out preparation works prior to the power cut as we appreciate your area has been impacted with unplanned power cuts in the last 6 months. During this time, you will be connected to a generator to provide you with electricity whilst we carry out the works. To connect and disconnect the generator we will need to switch off your power temporarily. This work is taking place in multiple locations near Hampton Lane, Bulltown Lane, School Lane and Weekes Lane. Multiple road closures will be in place to allow the work to be carried out safely.",

Because of this, they have had to stop work for safety until the Gas Board have attended and carried out the repairs. At the moment, we are not able to provide a new estimated restoration time until the leak has been repaired and we are able to carry on with our works. \n\nWe're sorry this is taking longer than expected, and we'll continue to keep you up to date, but if any change to this time comes in from our staff I'll let you know as soon as we hear.",

We have already sent staff to the area, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting the electricity around the faulty section. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will locate and repair the issue, which will take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",

        "Comment": "Sent by Roland at 14:11 - Our engineers are on their way. We believe the issue is a faulty underground cable that initially interrupted power to 1697 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 1090 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 17:00 and 18:00, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?
