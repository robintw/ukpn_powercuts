We didn't know this was going to happen, so time frames we provide throughout are estimated and are subject to change.\n\nOur estimated time to have power back on is currently between 12:00 and 13:00, but after we arrive and assess the situation this may change. The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",

Our team of cable jointers have now identified the suspected section of faulted underground cabling using their specialist equipment.\n\nOur digging team will now begin excavations, and this can take some time depending on the surface material, and how much space is needed to allow our engineers to assess the fault and make their repairs safely. \n\nOur estimated time frame of 22:00-23:00 doesn't need to change currently. We'll continue to keep you updated, but our team are always here if you have any questions.",

Our engineers are still on site in the Glendarvon Street area working on locating the faulty underground electrical equipment so they can start repairs and restore you power. At the moment we don't need to change the estimated timeframe.\n\nWe're sorry for the disruption this power cut may be causing. If you're worried about elderly or ill neighbours, we can offer help and support to our vulnerable customers during a power cut.

        "Comment": "Thanks for your patience today. We know a power cut can be difficult, especially in colder weather.\n\nMany properties have gas hobs, which can still be used in a power cut for cooking, or heating water for drinks and sterilisation of baby bottles. The spark to ignite the hob will not work however, so if you do use it please take extra care when using other ignition sources like matches or lighters. Even in daytime, the light in your house may be low in a power cut, so only do this if you are confident it can be done safely.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns, our team are always on hand to help.",

This means we have been able to restore power sooner than we anticipated, we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.",

We believe the issue is an underground network fault that initially interrupted power to 1732 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 264 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 18:30 and 19:30, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

We have already sent staff to the area, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting the electricity around the faulty section. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will locate and repair the issue, which will take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",

We believe there may be an underlying issue causing this, but it is proving difficult for our engineers to locate and therefore fix. To get your power back on today we have reconfigured the local electricity network. This in turn will both help pinpoint the issue and minimise further interruptions.\n\nIf you'd like more information on the issue, or if your power isn't back on, call us on 08003163105. We know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",

The issue was caused by an unexpected fault with some of our network equipment, which our engineers have now replaced.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",
