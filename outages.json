Thanks for bearing with us during the power cut, I know the lights being off is a worry.\n\nOur staff have advised that they are still working to restore power to the final 7 properties . Due to the delay this has caused, they've advised a new time of between 14:30 and 15:30 to have your power back on.\n\nI know another delay is frustrating; our engineers always try to give us the best estimate that they can but due to the safety elements of working with live electricity, sometimes they have to adjust their repairs at short notice.\n\nI'm sorry if this has caused you to change any plans you've made, but we'll be here to update you until the lights are safely back on.",

Our engineers have now safely connected a temporary generator, and this will be providing your power while our engineers work to fully repair the unexpected overhead network cabling fault.\n\nDepending on what the issue is, it may take a few days for our engineers to plan in the work and make their repairs, but once this is completed safely the generator can be removed, and network power will be resumed.\n\nWe're sorry for the length of time you were without power. If you'd like any further information, or if your power is not restored, please call us any time on 08003163105.",

We're arranging staff to attend ASAP, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting electricity. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to get as many customers back on as we can.\n\nOnce available, our engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, they will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will work to locate the issue and make repairs, which may take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing but we'll always give you the clearest information we have.",
