We have now restored power to all but one property. We're sorry for any disruption this unexpected power cut caused.\n\nIf your power isn't back on, we'd still like to keep you updated. If we aren't currently in contact with you by phone or in person at your property, please call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage and how long you were off for. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",

The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",

The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",

        "Comment": "We're sorry your power has gone off again.\n\nWe believe there may be an underlying issue causing the recent power cuts, but due to the nature of the electricity network, the heat created by a developing fault can cause a break in a cable to reseal itself. This can make it difficult to locate, so while our engineers are testing our equipment thoroughly to pinpoint the issue, this kind of problem may interrupt power multiple times before it's possible for us to fix.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nI'll keep you updated. Sent by David at 18:22",

For now we have restored your power as quickly as we can.\n\nIf your power isn't on or you would like to talk to us, call us for free on 08003163105. We know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",

They will start running tests at our substation to see how the local network is operating.\n\nIt's quite common for power to be restored briefly and go off again; this is our engineers using testing equipment to energise different sections of our network - this helps to narrow down any possible issues.\n\nOur cabling network is often broken down by smaller sites, and our staff may also check these to test for any problems, and they may also walk the cabling route to see if there are any signs of malfunction that have appeared on the surface. Our time frame hasn't been adjusted, so for now I'll let you know more news as soon as our staff update us.\n\nSent by Bev at 19:38.",

They have diverted power around the underground cable fault.\n\nWe know some properties in the area may have faced other recent interruptions, and we're sorry for the extra disruption. Every outage is fully investigated by our engineers, though power may be lost several times before we can safely find and fix the issue. Our customer services team will keep as many customers updated as possible during these investigations. \n\nWe're sorry for the unplanned disruption. If you need to talk to us, or let us know that your power isn't restored, call us on 08003163105.",
