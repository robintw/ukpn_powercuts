Our contractors have advised us that the 6 affected properties will be restored slightly early at approximately 10:15. This is because they have had better access using vehicles. We can confirm that once power has been restored to the area that the works to test a transformer near Tempsford Road will be completed which will improve the reliability of the network and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut in the future. Our reference number for this work is INCD-23945-O. I hope that the power coming on earlier is of benefit to you.

        "Comment": "Good morning, this is a message from Ryan at UK Power Networks regarding the planned power cut which is currently in progress today the 15th of December 2025 in the SG19 postcode area. Our contractors have advised us that the 6 affected properties will be restored slightly early at approximately 10:15. This is because they have had better access using vehicles. We can confirm that once power has been restored to the area that the works to test a transformer near Tempsford Road will be completed which will improve the reliability of the network and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut in the future. Our reference number for this work is INCD-23945-O. I hope that the power coming on earlier is of benefit to you. We always aim to provide a 10/10 service, if you feel we have not delivered you a 10/10 service then please call us on 105.",

We didn't know this was going to happen, so time frames we provide throughout are estimated and are subject to change.\n\nOur estimated time to have power back on is currently between 02:30 and 03:30, but after we arrive and assess the situation this may change. The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",

The issue was caused by an unexpected fault with some of our network equipment, which our engineers have now replaced.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

They may also walk our cabling route throughout the area to check for any visible problems, check smaller electrical sites in the area, or apply specialist equipment which may restore power temporarily to help them with their testing.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nWe'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",

We have already sent staff to the area, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting the electricity around the faulty section. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will locate and repair the issue, which will take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",
