This has identified 39 poles that need replacing and 12 poles that need refurbishing. Doing this will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut in the future as we appreciate your area has been impacted with unplanned power cuts in the last 6 months. Our contractors may carry out preparation works prior to the power cut. During this time, you will be connected to a generator to provide you with electricity whilst we carry out the works. To connect and disconnect the generator we will need to switch off your power temporarily. Please can customers who have solar panels isolate these to try avoid potential generator issues.

Our engineers have resolved the issue by making repairs to the network fault.\n\nWe know that a power cut can be difficult, and I'm sorry for the length of the time you were without your electricity. Please rest assured that our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

We understand how difficult a power cut can be, we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.",

In addition to this, they are liaising closely with our control room to find safe and reliable ways to divert power around any problems and get everyone restored.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them. We'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",

Our engineers have now safely connected a temporary generator, and this will be providing your power while our engineers work to fully repair the unexpected fault on our underground cables.\n\nDepending on what the issue is, it may take a few days for our engineers to plan in the work and make their repairs, but once this is completed safely the generator can be removed, and network power will be resumed.\n\nIf you'd like any further information, or if your power is not restored, please call us any time on 08003163105.",

        "Comment": "Sent by Simon at 20:05 - Engineers are on their way. At this point we think the issue is a fault with equipment in your local substation in the West Green Road N15 5 area. We didn't know this was going to happen, so time frames we provide throughout are estimated and are subject to change.\n\nOur estimated time to have power back on is currently between 22:30 and 23:30, but after we arrive and assess the situation this may change. The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",
