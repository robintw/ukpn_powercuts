        "Message": "Good morning, this is a message from Ryan at UK Power Networks regarding the planned power cut that is scheduled for today the 5th of December 2025 in the CB8 postcode area. Our contractors have advised us that unfortunately there is going to be a delay in the power being switched off. This is due to them still re-configuring the network before the power can safely be switched off. We now estimate to switch off your power at approximately 11:15. Our contractors are hopeful that the delay in the power being switched off will not result in a delay in power being restored. Our reference number for this work is INCD-23813-O. We would like to apologise for any inconvenience this may cause you. If you have any questions or you have moved from the CB8 postcode area, then please call 105.",

        "Comment": "Sent by Will at 00:27 - We believe our engineers have been able to restore power to all 2495 customers in the Rye, TN31 6 area, by diverting power around the overhead network fault. This means we have been able to restore power sooner than we anticipated, we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.",

For now we have restored your power as quickly as we can.\n\nIf your power isn't on or you would like to talk to us, call us for free on 08003163105. We know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",

However, this could change once our staff have assessed the local network.\n\nWe believe the power cuts you have been experiencing are caused by a fault with one of the cables. Developing faults can start very small, and so can be hard to detect but each power cut usually makes it easier to see, which means our specialist staff can detect it, and work on the repair to prevent further outages.\n\nI'll let you know once our teams arrive.",

        "Comment": "Sent by Talie at 11:00 - Our engineers have restored power to all properties in the CM3 6 area, and we're pleased that this is sooner than we estimated. They have diverted power around the overhead cable fault.\n\nWe know some properties in the area may have faced other recent interruptions, and we're sorry for the extra disruption. Every outage is fully investigated by our engineers, though power may be lost several times before we can safely find and fix the issue. Our customer services team will keep as many customers updated as possible during these investigations. \n\nWe're sorry for the unplanned disruption. If you need to talk to us, or let us know that your power isn't restored, call us on 08003163105.",

Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

Our engineers have now investigated the overhead cable on the ground, and have deemed it safe to restore power back to all 24 properties in the Maidstone ME17 1 area.\n\nWe're very sorry we had to turn your power off unexpectedly, and with so little warning. We usually provide much more notice if we can, but in a situation like this our first priority is the safety of the public and our staff.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. If your power is still off or if you have any questions, call our team on 08003163105.",

They may also walk our cabling route throughout the area to check for any visible problems, check smaller electrical sites in the area, or apply specialist equipment which may restore power temporarily to help them with their testing.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nWe'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",

We understand how difficult a power cut can be, we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.",

Using an average timescale for this type of issue, we're looking to have you back on between 21:00 and 22:00, however we must stress that this time may change, depending on what our staff find.\n\nWe know that a power cut can be very disruptive; we understand this can greatly impact your daily activities and we want to support you however we can. We'll update you with all of our progress, but for more information about this type of fault; here's a short YouTube video https://bit.ly/2y8Dtfz. Sent by Simon at 17:50.",

This can make it difficult to locate, so while our engineers are testing our equipment thoroughly to pinpoint the issue, this kind of problem may interrupt power multiple times before it's possible for us to fix.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nI'll keep you updated. Sent by Simon at 19:14",

We believe the issue is an overhead fault that initially interrupted power to 268 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 37 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 21:30 and 22:30 but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?
