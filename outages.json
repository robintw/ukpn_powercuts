For now we have restored your power as quickly as we can.\n\nIf your power isn't on or you would like to talk to us, call us for free on 08003163105.

They will start running tests at our substation to see how the local network is operating.\n\nIt's quite common for power to be restored briefly and go off again; this is our engineers using testing equipment to energise different sections of our network - this helps to narrow down any possible issues.\n\nOur cabling network is often broken down by smaller sites, and our staff may also check these to test for any problems, and they may also walk the cabling route to see if there are any signs of malfunction that have appeared on the surface. Our time frame hasn't been adjusted, so for now I'll let you know more news as soon as our staff update us.\n\nSent by Theo at 10:14.",

Our engineers have advised us that the 15 affected properties will be restored early at approximately 09:50 as the works have progressed quicker than expected due to having good access to our equipment. We can confirm that once power has been restored to the area that the works to examine a transformer near New House Lane will be completed which will improve the reliability of the network and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut in the future. Our reference number for this work is INCD-16202-I. I hope that the power coming on earlier is of benefit to you.

        "Comment": "Good morning, this is a message from Alicia at UK Power Networks regarding the planned power cut which is currently in progress today the 4th of December 2025 in the CB10 postcode area. Our engineers have advised us that the 15 affected properties will be restored early at approximately 09:50 as the works have progressed quicker than expected due to having good access to our equipment. We can confirm that once power has been restored to the area that the works to examine a transformer near New House Lane will be completed which will improve the reliability of the network and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut in the future. Our reference number for this work is INCD-16202-I. I hope that the power coming on earlier is of benefit to you. We always aim to provide a 10/10 service, if you feel we have not delivered you a 10/10 service then please call us on 105.",

However, due to the location and complexity of the issue, we have also used temporary generators to restore power to the last of the affected properties. This will provide power until our engineers plan in and safely complete the full repair, which may take a few days.\n\nWe're really sorry for any disruption this unexpected power cut caused. If your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

Our engineers had to unexpectedly turn off the power to 889 customers in the Chrishall, Littlebury, Elmdon, CB11 4 area to safely repair a overhead cable that had came down.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage.

Our engineers have turned off the power in the Chrishall, Littlebury, Elmdon, CB11 4 area in the interest of the public's health and safety. This is so they can investigate reports of a low overhead line.\n\nIf in the area, please take care and stay at least 10m away from the cable. \n\nUntil our engineers arrive on site and investigate, it's difficult to advise you a time frame.  However, based on an average for this kind of issue, our estimated time to have you back on is between 1430 - 1530. \n\nWe'll keep you updated with our progress, but in the meantime our team are always here to talk on 105 if you have any questions or concerns.",

We know a power cut can be difficult; we're sorry for any disruption this unplanned power cut caused.  \n\nWe know some properties in the area may have faced other recent interruptions, and we're sorry for the extra disruption. Every outage is fully investigated by our engineers, though power may be lost several times before we can safely find and fix the issue. Our customer services team will keep as many customers updated as possible during these investigations.\n\nTo talk to us, or let us know that your power isn't restored, call us on 08003163105.\n",

        "Comment": "Sent by Roland at 14:43 - Our engineers have now restored power to all 536 customers in the BN5/BN44/ RH13 area, by removing a large tree from our overhead cables & repaired the damaged power lines. We know power may have been off for a long time; we're sorry for any disruption this unplanned power cut caused. \n\nWe know some properties in the area may have faced other recent interruptions, and we're sorry for the extra disruption. Every outage is fully investigated by our engineers, though power may be lost several times before we can safely find and fix the issue. Our customer services team will keep as many customers updated as possible during these investigations\n\nTo talk to us, or let us know that your power isn't restored, call us on 08003163105",

        "Comment": "Our engineers have just called in to advise us that the tree has been removed from our cabling and they are now in the process of repairing the line.\n\nUnfortunately, it's going to take us past our current time frame to complete this safely, so we're now working towards between 15:00 and 16:00 to have power back on.\n\nWe can appreciate how frustrating and disruptive being without power can be, and our staff are working as fast as they can. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to speak to our team, but I'll let you know further news as it comes in from site. Sent by Talie at 13:56.",

This essential work helps to provide a reliable electricity supply to your property, reducing the risk of any unplanned power cuts in the future as we appreciate your area has been impacted with 4 unplanned power cuts in the last 6 months. To keep everyone safe while we carry out these works, we will need to temporarily turn off your electricity. We are taking extra measures to limit the time your power is off and we'll do our best to cause as little disruption as possible.

I know having power cuts as often as this must be very disruptive, and our staff are doing everything they can to get this resolved.\n\nThey are still testing our network in the area, and depending on the local infrastructure this can take some time. However, once they update us we'll know if our estimated time frame needs to change and why, and I'll let you know as soon as we hear.\n\nIn the meantime, if we can offer any support or advice, our team are always available to talk on 105.\n\nSent by Theo at 12:37.",

Using an average timescale for this type of issue, we're looking to have you back on between 15:00 and 16:00, however we must stress that this time may change, depending on what our staff find.\n\nWe know that a power cut can be very disruptive; we understand this can greatly impact your daily activities and we want to support you however we can. We'll update you with all of our progress, but for more information about this type of fault; here's a short YouTube video https://bit.ly/2y8Dtfz. Sent by Theo at 12:11.",

    "PlannedIncidentReason": "To provide a reliable electricity supply to your property, we carry out regular inspections of trees near our overhead cables. This has identified trees that have grown close, which could damage the cables and affect your electricity supply. To reduce future planned power cuts we will also be examining a piece of equipment on our electricity pole called a transformer which was originally scheduled for the 2nd December 2025. Our engineers need to temporarily switch off your power so we can safely cut the trees away from the cables and examine the transformer. Doing this will improve the reliability of the network and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut in the future. This work is taking place in the Stanstead Hall area.",
