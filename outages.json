This essential work helps to provide a reliable electricity supply to your property, reducing the risk of any unplanned power cuts in the future.

        "Comment": "Good morning, this is Donna from UK Power Networks, with a quick update regarding the planned works taking place today. I have spoken to the engineers working in your area and I am pleased to say the works are progressing well and at this stage, we are still aiming to have the power back on between 13:30 and 14:30. Our staff working do appreciate it is colder this time of year, and they will do all they can to get the power back on earlier if possible. Rest assured, if anything changes, we will of course let you know. For any more information, please visit our website or call us on 105. Thank you.",

There are now only 2 properties without power, who we'll speak to directly. If you're without power and haven't been contacted, then we'll need to hear from you. Please call us on 08003163105 (free from landlines and mobiles).\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the unexpected outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",

We have now restored power to all but one property. We're sorry for any disruption this unexpected power cut caused.\n\nIf your power isn't back on, we'd still like to keep you updated. If we aren't currently in contact with you by phone or in person at your property, please call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage and how long you were off for. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",

Thanks for bearing with us during the power cut, I know the lights being off is a worry.\n\nOur staff have advised that repairs to the fault are progressing, however it's taking longer than expected. Due to this, they've advised a new time of 01:30-02:30 to have your power back on.\n\nI know another delay is frustrating; our engineers always try to give us the best estimate that they can but due to the safety elements of working with live electricity, sometimes they have to adjust their repairs at short notice.\n\nI'm sorry if this has caused you to change any plans you've made, but we'll be here to update you until the lights are safely back on.",

We have now restored power to all but one property. We're sorry for any disruption this unexpected power cut caused.\n\nIf your power isn't back on, we'd still like to keep you updated. If we aren't currently in contact with you by phone or in person at your property, please call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",

Depending on the fault, it may take several days for our engineers to pinpoint the problem and plan in the work. The temporary generators will remain on site to provide power until we can locate the issue and restore the network back to normal running conditions.\n\nIf you'd like any further information, our team are always here to help.
