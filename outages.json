Our staff are working as quickly as they can to get the lights back on, and they've advised us that there are now 14 properties still affected.\n\nThey have managed to get a further 95 of our customers back on by diverting electricity, so your power may have come on sooner than we originally advised.\n\nIf you're still off, please don't worry; work on the issue will continue along with SMS updates until everyone is back on.\n\nTo stop receiving texts, just follow this link https://bit.ly/348KOZ3 to unsubscribe.",

For now we have restored your power as quickly as we can.\n\nIf your power isn't on or you would like to talk to us, call us for free on 08003163105.

This can make it difficult to locate, so while our engineers are testing our equipment thoroughly to pinpoint the issue, this kind of problem may interrupt power multiple times before it's possible for us to fix.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nI'll keep you updated. Sent by Kevin at 10:35",

Please rest assured that our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

        "Comment": "Hi, just an update from Simon at 21:13. I wanted to let you know that our ground teams have managed to restore some further power, but as they've been hard at work restoring power, we've only just been informed.\n\nThey managed to divert power to a further 89 customers, leaving 69 properties still without electricity. I'm sorry for the delay letting you know, but if your lights are back on you can stop our SMS updates any time; just visit our website here - https://bit.ly/348KOZ3.\n\nI know it must be frustrating if your power is still off, but our staff are making progress and I'll let you know more news as soon as we have it.",

They are now working to repair the damage on our overhead cables.\n\nWith darkness now upon us we understand that it can be unsettling to have a power cut. It may help to locate a torch and anything else you may need so you can have it to hand just in case.\n\nIf you have any concerns please do not hesitate to contact our team, but we will work to fix the problem as quickly and safely as possible.

We have already sent staff to the area, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting the electricity around the faulty section. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will locate and repair the issue, which will take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",

        "Comment": "Thanks for bearing with us during the power cut today. Our staff have confirmed they have diverted power around the overhead network fault and managed to restore power to the King's Lynn, PE32 1 and PE33 0 area by approximately 14:46.\n\nWe apologise that this final update is delayed. After restoring supplies, our engineers first need to carry out essential safety tests before they are able to call us to confirm that everyone has been restored.\n\nWe're sorry for any disruption caused by this unexpected power cut, but if your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.

This leaves 128 properties affected by the overhead network fault\n\nOur staff are checking our equipment throughout the area to pinpoint the issue on our network. In addition to this, they are liaising closely with our control room to find safe and reliable ways to divert power around any problems and get everyone restored. \n\nYou may be worried about the food in your fridge and freezer. Food should keep for up to 6 hours in the fridge, and between 15-24 hours in the freezer if you can avoid opening them. \n\nIf your power is back on and you wish to stop receiving texts, just follow this link https://bit.ly/348KOZ3 to unsubscribe.",

Our staff are working as quickly as they can to get the lights back on, and they've advised us that there are now 211 properties still affected.\n\nThey have managed to get a further 256 of our customers back on by diverting electricity, so your power may have come on sooner than we originally advised.\n\nIf you're still off, please don't worry; work on the issue will continue along with SMS updates until everyone is back on.\n\nTo stop receiving texts, just follow this link https://bit.ly/348KOZ3 to unsubscribe.",

Our staff have confirmed they have diverted the power around an overhead network fault and managed to restore power to the RM13 & RM15 area by approximately 1446\n\nWe apologise that this final update is delayed. After restoring supplies, our engineers first need to carry out essential safety tests before they are able to call us to confirm that everyone has been restored.\n\nWe're sorry for any disruption caused by this unexpected power cut, but if your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.
