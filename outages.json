It was just to let you know that our customer support vehicle is on site and is located on the junction of Chapel Road, Gravel Bank and School Road where they will provide free hot drinks, charging points, Wi-Fi and face-to-face support. Please feel free to visit Simon from our welfare team if you require any assistance whilst the power is off. Our reference number for this is INCD-24390-O. If you have any questions or you have moved from the PE14 or PE34 postcode areas, then please call 105.",

Doing this will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut in the future as we appreciate that some customers may have experienced multiple unplanned power cuts in the last 6 months. To complete the work safely, we need to turn your power off to upgrade the poles. To ensure the power is off for the shortest possible time, our contractors Avidety may carry out preparation works prior to the power cut. This work is taking place near Yaugher Lane. A road closure will be in place from 09:00am - 17:00pm to allow the work to be carried out safely. Access to your property will always be provided.",

The issue was caused by an unexpected fault on our underground cables, which our engineers have bene able to remove from the network.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured that our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

This will allow them to cut our cable, and using specialist equipment, test each side to help narrow down where the fault lies.\n\nDue to the surface material and how much space will be needed for our engineers to assess and locate the fault and make their repairs safely, we're now estimating power will be back on by 04:30-05:30.\n\nWe'll continue to keep you updated, but our team are always here on 08003163105 from any phone if you have any questions.

Our engineers have now  repaired the low hanging overhead cable, and have deemed it safe to restore power back to all 107 properties in the Chediston Green area.\n\nWe're very sorry we had to turn your power off unexpectedly, and with so little warning. We usually provide much more notice if we can, but in a situation like this our first priority is the safety of the public and our staff.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. If your power is still off or if you have any questions, call our team on 08003163105.",

They are going to test our equipment thoroughly to check if the underlying issue can be located before they attempt to restore your power again.\n\nI know having power cuts this often must be causing you a lot of problems, and our staff are doing everything they can to keep the power on. Our estimated time frame is currently between 14:00 and 15:00, although as we mentioned previously this can be subject to change.\n\nWe're keeping in touch with our staff regularly to make sure you have the best information to plan ahead. I'll update you as soon as we hear more from them.",

We believe our engineers have been able to restore power to all 1602 customers in the Wisbech, PE13 1 area by diverting power around a faulted piece of underground network equipment.. We're pleased that we have been able to restore power sooner than we estimated.\n\nIf your power isn't back on, we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on.

We believe the issue is an underground network fault that initially interrupted power to 1602 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 510 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 14:30-15:30, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

We're arranging staff to attend ASAP, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting electricity. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to get as many customers back on as we can.\n\nOnce available, our engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, they will attempt to restore more power from there.
