They will then check our network equipment throughout the area to try and identify any problems, before trying to restore power.\n\nOur estimated time frame of 22:00 and 23:00 hasn't changed, but if this is not successful it's possible that a cable repair may be needed.

As there have been other power cuts recently it's difficult to know what repairs will be needed to restore your power safely, so time frames we provide throughout have to be estimated.\n\nThe results of our engineer's tests on our network will let us know if our estimate needs to be adjusted, so we'll update you as soon as we hear more from site.

Engineers have arrived on site to investigate what we believe to be an issue at the local substation in the Sims Close area.\n\nUsing an average timescale for this type of issue, we're looking to have you back on between 23:30 and 00:30, however we must stress that this time may change, depending on what our staff find. As there have been other power cuts recently it's difficult to know what repairs will be needed to restore your power safely, so time frames we provide throughout have to be estimated.\n\nThe results of our engineer's tests on our network will let us know if our estimate needs to be adjusted, so we'll update you as soon as we hear more from site.
