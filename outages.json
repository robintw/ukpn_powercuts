Our contractors Avidety have advised that unfortunately there is going to be a delay in restoring your power. This is due to safety issues with equipment failure which delayed the works from being started safely. We now estimate to restore your power between approximately 20:30-21:30.

This can make it difficult to locate, so while our engineers are testing our equipment thoroughly to pinpoint the issue, this kind of problem may interrupt power multiple times before it's possible for us to fix.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nI'll keep you updated. Sent by Adam at 20:14",

        "Comment": "Sent by Simon at 03:17 - We believe our engineers have been able to restore power to all 2007 customers in the London SE23 area by diverting power around an underground cable fault. We're pleased that we have been able to restore power sooner than we estimated.\n\nIf your power isn't back on, we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.",
