Thanks for your patience today, our field staff and control room engineers are working to get your power back on as quickly as they can.\n\nOur records show that some properties affected by today's power cut may have had other unexpected interruptions recently. If you have, we're sorry for further disruption. All power cuts are fully investigated by our engineers but can sometimes happen multiple times before we can safely find the issue and fix it.\n\nWe know that not everyone affected by today's power cut will have had other power cuts recently, but we want you to know that if you have, our customer services team will try to update as many customers as possible about our investigations.",

Our engineers are still on site in the Brian Crescent area working on digging down to the faulty underground electrical equipment so they can work on repairs and restore your power. At the moment we don't need to change the estimated timeframe.\n\nWe're sorry for the disruption this power cut may be causing. If you're worried about elderly or ill neighbours, we can offer help and support to our vulnerable customers during a power cut. Find out more here: https://bit.ly/40quttu.\n\nIf you have any concerns, please call us on 08003163105",

        "Comment": "Thanks for your patience today. We know a power cut can be difficult, especially in colder weather.\n\nMany properties have gas hobs, which can still be used in a power cut for cooking, or heating water for drinks and sterilisation of baby bottles. The spark to ignite the hob will not work however, so if you do use it please take extra care when using other ignition sources like matches or lighters. Even in daytime, the light in your house may be low in a power cut, so only do this if you are confident it can be done safely.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns, our team are always on hand to help.",

To get your power back on today we have reconfigured the local electricity network.

We believe there may be an underlying issue causing this, but it is proving difficult for our engineers to locate and therefore fix. To get your power back on today we have reconfigured the local electricity network. This in turn will both help pinpoint the issue and minimise further interruptions.\n\nIf you'd like more information on the issue, or if your power isn't back on, call us on 08003163105.

Our engineers had to unexpectedly turn off the power to 539 customers in the TN15 7 area to safely investigate reports of  a tree that was laying on our overhead electrical cables which we now deem same.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

This is why a wide area has lost electricity.\n\nOur field teams are working to fix the issue as quickly as possible, and we'll start diverting power back to affected homes as soon as they advise us it's safe. You may notice your lights going on and off as we work to get as much power restored as we can.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",

They have restored power remotely around the faulty overhead electrical equipment\n\nWe know some properties in the area may have faced other recent interruptions, and we're sorry for the extra disruption. Every outage is fully investigated by our engineers, though power may be lost several times before we can safely find and fix the issue. Our customer services team will keep as many customers updated as possible during these investigations. \n\nWe're sorry for the unplanned disruption. If you need to talk to us, or let us know that your power isn't restored, call us on 08003163105.",

We believe the issue is faulty overhead electrical equipment that initially interrupted power to 1265 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 81 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 14:00-15:00, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

We're arranging staff to attend ASAP, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting electricity. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to get as many customers back on as we can.\n\nOnce available, our engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, they will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will work to locate the issue and make repairs, which may take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing but we'll always give you the clearest information we have.",

        "Comment": "Sent by Bev at 18:32 - Engineers are on their way. At this point we think the issue is a fault with equipment in your local substation in the Essenden Road area. We didn't know this was going to happen, so time frames we provide throughout are estimated and are subject to change.\n\nOur estimated time to have power back on is currently between 23:30 and 00:30, but after we arrive and assess the situation this may change. The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",
