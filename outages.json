Doing this will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut in the future as we appreciate your area has been impacted with unplanned power cuts in the last 6 months.

Our engineers have advised us that the 9 affected properties will be restored early by approximately 13:00 as the works have progressed well. We can confirm that once power has been restored to the area that the works to carry out maintenance on a transformer and trim trees around our overhead cables in High Green will be completed which will improve the reliability of the network and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut in the future.

        "Comment": "Good afternoon, this is a message from Ryan at UK Power Networks regarding the planned power cut which is currently in progress today the 15th of January 2026 in the IP25 postcode area. Our engineers have advised us that the 9 affected properties will be restored early by approximately 13:00 as the works have progressed well. We can confirm that once power has been restored to the area that the works to carry out maintenance on a transformer and trim trees around our overhead cables in High Green will be completed which will improve the reliability of the network and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut in the future. Our reference number for this work is INCD-106312-C. I hope that the power coming on earlier is of benefit to you. We always aim to provide a 10/10 service, if you feel we have not delivered you a 10/10 service then please call us on 105.",

The suspected underground cabling issue is not yet appearing on any of our tests, so for the moment we have restored your power as quickly as possible.\n\nI'm afraid this may happen again, but every time you lose power it gives us a better chance of pinpointing the problem.

Our time frame hasn't been adjusted, so for now I'll let you know more news as soon as our staff update us.\n\nSent by Roland at 06:51.",

The issue was caused by an unexpected fault with some of our network equipment, which our engineers have now replaced.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

We didn't know this was going to happen, so time frames we provide throughout are estimated and are subject to change.\n\nOur estimated time to have power back on is currently between 11:00 and 12:00, but after we arrive and assess the situation this may change. The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",
