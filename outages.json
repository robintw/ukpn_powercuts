This means we have been able to restore power sooner than we anticipated, we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on.

Thank you for your patience while our engineers continue works on the overhead network thats has been damaged by a tree falling onto it in the Street area.

If you have, we're sorry for further disruption. All power cuts are fully investigated by our engineers but can sometimes happen multiple times before we can safely find the issue and fix it.\n\nWe know that not everyone affected by today's power cut will have had other power cuts recently, but we want you to know that if you have, our customer services team will try to update as many customers as possible about our investigations.",

Our engineers will restore your power as quickly as they can, and my team will update you with all of their progress.\n\nIf you have any concerns or want to speak to us about anything, call us any time on 08003163105 and press the option for power cuts.",

We have already sent staff to the area, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting the electricity around the faulty section. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will locate and repair the issue, which will take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",

I understand that having a power cut over Christmas Day is especially difficult, as you may have celebrations planned which will be impacted by the lights going out. \n\nI wanted to reassure you that our office and field staff work 365 days a year to ensure that power cuts are fixed, and that you always have someone to speak to. Our engineers will restore your power as quickly as they can, and my team will update you with all of their progress.\n\nIf you have any concerns or want to speak to us about anything, call us any time on 08003163105 and press the option for power cuts.",

We're aware that some properties may be off supply completely. Usually, this is due to interference with cabling and can sometimes cause network safety equipment to partially operate, meaning not all power is coming through to your property as normal.\n\nAt the moment our time frame to have power back on is between 10:00 and 11:00, but once our staff have fully assessed the situation this could change. Also in some cases we have to restore power in stages; so it's normal to continue receiving messages for a while even after your power has come back on",
