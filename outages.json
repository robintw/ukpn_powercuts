The power was switched off in stages by 12:09 to enable our contractors to run some essential checks on a piece of equipment called a transformer near Whitegates Lane. Our contractors have advised us that works have progressed well and the 38 affected properties will be restored early in stages by 13:30.  Once completed and power has been restored to the area, this has improved the reliability of the electricity network, ensured the equipment is running to the best of its ability and reduced the risk of you having an unplanned power cut. Our reference number for this work is INCD-326741-U. I hope that the power coming on earlier is of benefit to you. We always aim to provide a 10/10 service, if you feel we have not delivered you a 10/10 service then please call us on 105.",

        "Comment": "Good afternoon, this is a message from Donna at UK Power Networks regarding the planned power cut which is currently in progress today the 17th November 2025 in the TN5 postcode area. The power was switched off in stages by 12:09 to enable our contractors to run some essential checks on a piece of equipment called a transformer near Whitegates Lane. Our contractors have advised us that works have progressed well and the 38 affected properties will be restored early in stages by 13:30.  Once completed and power has been restored to the area, this has improved the reliability of the electricity network, ensured the equipment is running to the best of its ability and reduced the risk of you having an unplanned power cut. Our reference number for this work is INCD-326741-U. I hope that the power coming on earlier is of benefit to you. We always aim to provide a 10/10 service, if you feel we have not delivered you a 10/10 service then please call us on 105.",

        "Comment": "Sent by Kevin at 06:47 - Engineers are on their way. At this point we think the issue is a fault with equipment in your local substation in the Mount Road area. We didn't know this was going to happen, so time frames we provide throughout are estimated and are subject to change.\n\nOur estimated time to have power back on is currently between 10:00 and 11:00, but after we arrive and assess the situation this may change. The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",
