We believe the issue is an underground cable fault that initially interrupted power to 3592 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 1843 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 1330 -1430 but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

This means we have been able to restore power sooner than we anticipated, we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.",

In addition to this, they are liaising closely with our control room to find safe and reliable ways to divert power around any problems and get everyone restored.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice.

For now we have restored your power as quickly as we can.\n\nIf your power isn't on or you would like to talk to us, call us for free on 08003163105.

I know having power cuts as often as this must be very disruptive, and our staff are doing everything they can to get this resolved.\n\nThey are still testing our network in the area, and depending on the local infrastructure this can take some time. However, once they update us we'll know if our estimated time frame needs to change and why, and I'll let you know as soon as we hear.\n\nIn the meantime, if we can offer any support or advice, our team are always available to talk on 105.\n\nSent by Lee at 13:27.",

Due to there being multiple power cuts over a short space of time, our engineers are going to be testing if the network is still healthy.\n\nThey will start at the substation, and often apply specialist equipment that may turn your power back on for a brief period, so don't worry if your power comes on and goes off again. They will also check smaller sites which run along our cabling route, these break our network down into smaller sections and can help pinpoint any possible problems.\n\nOur estimated time frame of 1600 - 1700 hasn't changed, so I'll let you know more once our staff update us.

Today's power cut was unexpected, so we were unable to provide you with prior notice to help you plan ahead. I am pleased to confirm that we managed to resolve this by diverting power to get your lights back on as soon as possible.\n\nJust so you know, we text customers when we are made aware of problems like this, so if you would like to be notified in the future you can do so here https://bit.ly/3zyHC6L.\n\nThis was a widespread problem on the underground network and I personally apologise for any disruption this has caused to your day. If you have any questions or are still without power, please call us on 105.",

This means we have been able to restore power sooner than we anticipated, we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on.

This leaves 228 properties affected by the underground network fault. \n\nOur staff are checking our equipment throughout the area to pinpoint the issue on our network. In addition to this, they are liaising closely with our control room to find safe and reliable ways to divert power around any problems and get everyone restored. \n\nYou may be worried about the food in your fridge and freezer. Food should keep for up to 6 hours in the fridge, and between 15-24 hours in the freezer if you can avoid opening them. \n\nIf your power is back on and you wish to stop receiving texts, just follow this link https://bit.ly/348KOZ3 to unsubscribe.",

Today's power cut was unexpected, so we were unable to provide you with prior notice to help you plan ahead. I am pleased to confirm that we managed to resolve this by diverting power to get your lights back on as soon as possible.\n\nJust so you know, we text customers when we are made aware of problems like this, so if you would like to be notified in the future you can do so here https://bit.ly/3zyHC6L.\n\nThis was a widespread problem on the overhead network and I personally apologise for any disruption this has caused to your day. If you have any questions or are still without power, please call us on 105.",

They have diverted power around an overhead cable fault.\n\nWe know some properties in the area may have faced other recent interruptions, and we're sorry for the extra disruption. Every outage is fully investigated by our engineers, though power may be lost several times before we can safely find and fix the issue. Our customer services team will keep as many customers updated as possible during these investigations. \n\nWe're sorry for the unplanned disruption. If you need to talk to us, or let us know that your power isn't restored, call us on 08003163105.\n",

This can make it difficult to locate, so while our engineers are testing our equipment thoroughly to pinpoint the issue, this kind of problem may interrupt power multiple times before it's possible for us to fix.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nI'll keep you updated. Sent by Simon at 20:40",

This can make it difficult to locate, so while our engineers are testing our equipment thoroughly to pinpoint the issue, this kind of problem may interrupt power multiple times before it's possible for us to fix.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nI'll keep you updated. Sent by Simon at 20:40",

They will start running tests at our substation to see how the local network is operating.\n\nIt's quite common for power to be restored briefly and go off again; this is our engineers using testing equipment to energise different sections of our network - this helps to narrow down any possible issues.\n\nOur cabling network is often broken down by smaller sites, and our staff may also check these to test for any problems, and they may also walk the cabling route to see if there are any signs of malfunction that have appeared on the surface. Our time frame hasn't been adjusted, so for now I'll let you know more news as soon as our staff update us.\n\nSent by Will at 20:52.",

We didn't know this was going to happen, so time frames we provide throughout are estimated and are subject to change.\n\nOur estimated time to have power back on is currently between 00:00 and 01:00, but after we arrive and assess the situation this may change. The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",
