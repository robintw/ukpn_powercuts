Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 15:30 - 16:30, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

We believe the issue is a overhead network fault that initially interrupted power to 1411 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 404 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 15:30 - 16:30, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 12:30 - 13:30 but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

Today's power cut was an unexpected underground cable fault that affected 684 properties, so I'm sorry that we weren't able to provide you with prior notice. I'm pleased to report our staff have resolved this by diverting power to get your lights back on as soon as possible.\n\nWe contact customers when we are made aware of problems like this, so if you would like to be notified in future let us know here https://bit.ly/3zyHC6L\n\nI personally apologise for the disruption this caused you. We aim to provide a 10/10 service in keeping you updated, so if you'd like to talk to us about anything or are still without power, please call us on 105.",

        "Comment": "Sent by Roland at 10:08 - Our engineers are on their way. We believe the issue is a underground cable fault that initially interrupted power to 684 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 420 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 12:30 - 13:30 but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?
