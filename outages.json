Our engineers have now diverted power around the fault. Further work will be carried out on the network.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the unexpected outage.

Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on. If your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

They will then check our network equipment throughout the area to try and identify any problems, before trying to restore power.\n\nOur estimated time frame of 21:30 and 22:30 hasn't changed, but if this is not successful it's possible that a cable repair may be needed.

Our engineers have diverted power around the faulty underground cables to get the majority of customers back on. However, due to the location and complexity of the issue, we have also used a temporary generator to restore power to the last of the affected properties. This will provide power until our engineers plan in and safely complete the full repair, which may take a few days.\n\nWe're really sorry for any disruption this unexpected power cut caused. If your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n",

Our engineers have diverted power around the damage to get the majority of customers back on. However, due to the location and complexity of the issue, we have also used a temporary generator to restore power to the last of the affected properties. This will provide power until our engineers plan in and safely complete the full repair, which may take a few days.\n\nWe're really sorry for any disruption this unexpected power cut caused. If your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",
