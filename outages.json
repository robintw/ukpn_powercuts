We're arranging staff to attend ASAP, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting electricity. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to get as many customers back on as we can.\n\nOnce available, our engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, they will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will work to locate the issue and make repairs, which may take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing but we'll always give you the clearest information we have.",

We believe there may be a fault on our underground electricity cabling in the area, but currently it has not developed to a stage that our staff can pinpoint it. Their tests have proven inconclusive, so for now they have replaced our safety equipment at the substation to get your power back on as quickly as possible.\n\nThis may happen again before we're able to fix it, but if you'd like to talk to us about this, or if your power isn't on call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

Due to there being multiple power cuts over a short space of time, our engineers are going to be testing if the network is still healthy.\n\nThey will start at the substation, and often apply specialist equipment that may turn your power back on for a brief period, so don't worry if your power comes on and goes off again. They will also check smaller sites which run along our cabling route, these break our network down into smaller sections and can help pinpoint any possible problems.\n\nOur estimated time frame of 16:30 and 17:30 hasn't changed, so I'll let you know more once our staff update us.

I'm sorry for the power cut today; I know the lights going off can be disruptive.\n\nWe know that some customers affected by todays power cut may have had other issues recently, and I appreciate this is frustrating. High voltage cabling can cover a wide area, so sometimes properties very close to you may have had power cuts that you didn't experience.\n\nI know you may not have had any previous power cuts, but if you have, we often get progress updates from our field staff management about investigations into repeat issues, and our Customer Services team will try to contact everyone affected by them to explain what's happening.",
