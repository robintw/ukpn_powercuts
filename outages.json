To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on.

        "Comment": "We're sorry your power has gone off again.\n\nWe believe there may be an underlying issue causing the recent power cuts, but due to the nature of the electricity network, the heat created by a developing fault can cause a break in a cable to reseal itself. This can make it difficult to locate, so while our engineers are testing our equipment thoroughly to pinpoint the issue, this kind of problem may interrupt power multiple times before it's possible for us to fix.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nI'll keep you updated. Sent by Kevin at 19:49",

This means we have been able to restore power sooner than we anticipated, however we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on.

We didn't know this was going to happen, so time frames we provide throughout are estimated and are subject to change.\n\nOur estimated time to have power back on is currently between 02:00 and 03:00, but after we arrive and assess the situation this may change. The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",

        "Comment": "Hi, David here again. I understand that having a power cut on Christmas Day is especially difficult, as you may have celebrations planned which will be impacted by the lights going out. \n\nI wanted to reassure you that our office and field staff work 365 days a year to ensure that power cuts are fixed, and that you always have someone to speak to. Our engineers will restore your power as quickly as they can, and my team will update you with all of their progress.\n\nIf you have any concerns or want to speak to us about anything, call us any time on 08003163105 and press the option for power cuts.",

        "Comment": "What will happen next?\n\nThis outage is affecting multiple areas, so locations we mention may be further away than you'd expect. We have already sent staff to the area, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting the electricity around the faulty section. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will locate and repair the issue, which will take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",

By doing this, we've managed to restore power to 204 customers. There are now 170 properties still affected. We are estimating to have power restored between 12:00-13:00.\n\nWe'll keep sending SMS updates until everybody is restored.

I understand that having a power cut over Christmas Eve is especially difficult, as you may have celebrations planned which will be impacted by the lights going out. \n\nI wanted to reassure you that our office and field staff work 365 days a year to ensure that power cuts are fixed, and that you always have someone to speak to. You may find your power is going on and off; that is normal for this type of issue and is due to our engineers working to divert power remotely. By doing this, we've managed to restore power to 183 customers. There are now 705 properties still affected.\n\nWe'll keep sending SMS updates until everybody is restored.

We believe the issue is a fault on our overhead cables that initially interrupted power to 2104 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 888 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 10:00 and 11:00, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

We have already sent staff to the area, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting the electricity around the faulty section. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will locate and repair the issue, which will take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",
