We want to be as transparent as possible as we know having multiple power cuts is disruptive and worrying, so I would like to help explain why we can't always fix a problem like this right away.\n\nUnderground electricity cabling is insulated for safety and if a fault develops, these materials can re-seal due to heat passing through them when our safety equipment operates and your power is lost.
