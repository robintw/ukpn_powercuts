However, once they've assessed further we'll let you know if the time frame needs to change.\n\nI'll keep you updated.",

They may also walk our cabling route throughout the area to check for any visible problems, check smaller electrical sites in the area, or apply specialist equipment which may restore power temporarily to help them with their testing.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nWe'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",

        "Comment": "Sent by Stuart at 19:56 - We have been made aware that power has not been restored to the Lennard Road area. Our engineers investigated the fault earlier but it seems there may be a bigger underlying issue which is causing our substation equipment to operate repeatedly.\n\nThe estimated time frame remains between 22:00-23:00 at present, and we will continue to keep you informed of progress. If your power is back on, you will need to visit our website here - https://bit.ly/348KOZ3 to unsubscribe from receiving texts. Thank you",

The issue was caused by an unexpected fault with some of our network equipment, which our engineers have now replaced.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

They may also walk our cabling route throughout the area to check for any visible problems, check smaller electrical sites in the area, or apply specialist equipment which may restore power temporarily to help them with their testing.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nWe'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",

        "Comment": "Sent by Kevin at 21:27 - We can now confirm that all power in the IP12 1/4 area should be back on. Our engineers have diverted as power as they can around an underground network fault. However, due to the location and complexity of the issue, we have also used temporary generators to restore power to the last of the affected properties. This will provide power until our engineers plan in and safely complete the full repair, which may take a few days.\n\nWe're really sorry for any disruption this unexpected power cut caused. If your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

We've had an update from our staff that there are now 212 properties still affected by the underground network fault, as they have managed to safely connect a generator, getting the lights back on for another 48 of our customers.\n\nWe'll keep sending text updates to everyone until all the power to your area is on.
