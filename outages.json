I have spoken to the contractors working in your area and I am pleased to say the works are progressing well and at this stage, we are still aiming to have the power back on between 14:30 and 15:30. Our staff working do appreciate it is colder this time of year, and they will do all they can to get the power back on earlier if possible. Rest assured, if anything changes, we will of course let you know. For any more information, please visit our website or call us on 105. Thank you. VB & SMS sent.",

        "Comment": "Good afternoon, this is a message from Alicia at UK Power Networks regarding the planned power cut which is currently in progress today the 28th of January 2026 in the HP28 postcode area. Our engineers have advised us that the 11 affected properties will be restored early at approximately 14:00. This is because they have managed to carry out the works ahead of schedule. We can confirm that once power has been restored to the area that the works to upgrade a piece of equipment following a customer request for a new electricity supply near Tring Hill Roundabout will be completed which will adhere to the customer request, improve the reliability of the network and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut in the future. Our reference number for this work is INCD-576996-Z. I hope that the power coming on earlier is of benefit to you. We always aim to provide a 10/10 service, if you feel we have not delivered you a 10/10 service then please call us on 105.",

Our engineers are still on site in the  High Street area investigating why the power is off and looking at ways to restore the power. At the moment we don't have an estimated timeframe until the checks have been completed.\n\nWe're sorry for the disruption this power cut may be causing. If you're worried about elderly or ill neighbours, we can offer help and support to our vulnerable customers during a power cut.

However, due to the location and complexity of the issue, we have also used a temporary generator to restore power to the last of the affected properties. This will provide power until our engineers plan in and safely complete the full repair, which may take a few days.\n\nWe're really sorry for any disruption this unexpected power cut caused. If your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

Engineers ware now in the process of carrying these out, along with connecting a temporary generator to restore power. To allow time for this, the estimated time frame to restore your power is now between 19:00 and 20:00.\n\nWe're sorry this is taking longer than expected, and we'll continue to keep you up to date, but if any change to this time comes in from our staff I'll let you know as soon as we hear.",

We believe our engineers have been able to restore power to all 547 customers in the Old Hall Park area by diverting power around a faulted piece of overhead network equipment. We're pleased that we have been able to restore power sooner than we estimated.\n\nIf your power isn't back on, we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on.

We have already sent staff to the area, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting the electricity around the faulty section. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will locate and repair the issue, which will take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",

We believe the issue is an overhead cabling fault that initially interrupted power to 1228 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 320 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 11:00-12:00, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

We understand how difficult a power cut can be, and we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.\n",

        "Comment": "Sent by Chev at 16:57 - Our engineers are on their way. We believe the issue is underground cable fault that initially interrupted power to 1072 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 98 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 19:30-20:30, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?
