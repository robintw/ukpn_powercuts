    "PlannedIncidentReason": "To provide a reliable electricity supply to your property, we carry out regular inspections of our equipment in your area. This has identified 5 spans of overhead electricity cables and 5 electricity poles that need replacing and upgrading. Doing this will improve the reliability of the network and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut in the future as we appreciate you may have been impacted by unplanned power cuts in the last 6 months. To complete the work safely, we need to turn your power off to upgrade the equipment. To ensure the power is off for the shortest possible time, our contractors Avidety may carry out preparation works prior to the power cut. Avidety will need access to the inside of your property to conduct safety checks in the morning before we switch off the power and we will need to do another check when we turn the power back on. This work is taking place on Poynings Road. Traffic management will be in place to allow the work to be carried out safely.",

Our engineers have diverted power around the faulty underground cables to get the majority of customers back on. However, due to the location and complexity of the issue, we have also used a temporary generator to restore power to the last of the affected properties. This will provide power until our engineers plan in and safely complete the full repair, which may take a few days.\n\nWe're really sorry for any disruption this unexpected power cut caused. If your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n",
