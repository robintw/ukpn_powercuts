To allow time for us to get the generators out to your area and connect them, we're now estimating we'll have power back on between 21:30 and 22:30.\n\nWe're sorry to change the time frame and will let you know when they arrive.",

We know a power cut can be difficult, especially in colder weather.\n\nMany properties have gas hobs, which can still be used in a power cut for cooking, or heating water for drinks and sterilisation of baby bottles. The spark to ignite the hob will not work however, so if you do use it please take extra care when using other ignition sources like matches or lighters. Even in daytime, the light in your house may be low in a power cut, so only do this if you are confident it can be done safely.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns, our team are always on hand to help.",

Please accept our sincere apology as we know that it is difficult to be without power for a longer duration.\n\nIf your power isn't back on, we'll need to hear from you. To talk to us about this or anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles. We're really sorry for any disruption this caused.",

Due to this, they've advised a new time of 21:30-22:30 to have your power back on.\n\nI know another delay is frustrating; our engineers always try to give us the best estimate that they can but due to the safety elements of working with live electricity, sometimes they have to adjust their repairs at short notice.\n\nI'm sorry if this has caused you to change any plans you've made, but we'll be here to keep you updated.",

        "Message": "Sent by Luke at 15:36 - Our engineers are on their way. We believe the issue is an overhead fault that initially interrupted power to 2575 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 146 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 18:30 and 19:30 but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

The issue was caused by an unexpected overhead network fault, that caused our safety equipment at the local substation to operate. Our engineers have cleared the trees from the overhead network that was causing the issue and have been able to restore power.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured that our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",
