Our team have confirmed that a fault on the underground cabling is causing the outage and specialist teams will be needed in order to repair this.\n\nOur engineers have been working hard to get you back on, but due to the complexity of the repairs and with safety in mind, we now need to send out a relief team first thing in the morning. This means that you may not receive any texts for a while.\n\nWe'll let you know as soon as our staff re-attend and we have some more information, but if you have any concerns in the meantime you can always reach our team here on 105.",

They will start running tests at our substation to see how the local network is operating.\n\nIt's quite common for power to be restored briefly and go off again; this is our engineers using testing equipment to energise different sections of our network - this helps to narrow down any possible issues.\n\nOur cabling network is often broken down by smaller sites, and our staff may also check these to test for any problems, and they may also walk the cabling route to see if there are any signs of malfunction that have appeared on the surface. Our time frame hasn't been adjusted, so for now I'll let you know more news as soon as our staff update us.\n\nSent by Talie at 18:13.",

In addition to this, they are liaising closely with our control room to find safe and reliable ways to divert power around any problems and get everyone restored.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them. We'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",

We believe the issue is an underground network fault that initially interrupted power to 1795 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 97 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 07:00-08:00, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

We're arranging staff to attend ASAP, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting electricity. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to get as many customers back on as we can.\n\nOnce available, our engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, they will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will work to locate the issue and make repairs, which may take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing but we'll always give you the clearest information we have.",

        "Comment": "Sent by Talie at 17:36 - Engineers are on their way. At this point we think the issue is a fault with equipment in your local substation in the Minster Road area. We didn't know this was going to happen, so time frames we provide throughout are estimated and are subject to change.\n\nOur estimated time to have power back on is currently between 20:30 and 21:30, but after we arrive and assess the situation this may change. The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",

        "Comment": "We're sorry your power has gone off again.\n\nWe believe there may be an underlying issue causing the recent power cuts, but due to the nature of the electricity network, the heat created by a developing fault can cause a break in a cable to reseal itself. This can make it difficult to locate, so while our engineers are testing our equipment thoroughly to pinpoint the issue, this kind of problem may interrupt power multiple times before it's possible for us to fix.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nI'll keep you updated. Sent by Stuart at 00:44",

Using an average timescale for this type of issue, we're looking to have you back on between 02:30-03:30, however we must stress that this time may change, depending on what our staff find.\n\nWe know that a power cut can be very disruptive; we understand this can greatly impact your daily activities and we want to support you however we can.
