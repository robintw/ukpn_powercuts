The issue was caused by an unexpected underground cable fault, which our engineers repaired.\n\nWe know that a power cut can be difficult, and I'm sorry for the length of the time you were without your electricity. Please rest assured that our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

Thanks for bearing with us during the power cut, I know the lights being off is a worry.\n\nOur staff have advised that that the repair work is proving to be more complex than previously anticipated and as a result, we may need to turn off more power to enable safe repairs. Due to the delay this has caused, they've advised a new time of 01:00-02:00 to have your power back on.\n\nI know another delay is frustrating; our engineers always try to give us the best estimate that they can but due to the safety elements of working with live electricity, sometimes they have to adjust their repairs at short notice.\n",

The issue was caused by an unexpected overhead network fault, that caused our safety equipment at the local substation to operate. Our engineers have cleared the trees from the overhead network that was causing the issue and have been able to restore power.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured that our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

However, once they've assessed further we'll let you know if the time frame needs to change.\n\nFor more information about this type of fault; here's a short video <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2ScxQDZ\" target=\"_blank\">https://bit.ly/2ScxQDZ</a> - I'll keep you updated.",

We didn't know this was going to happen, so time frames we provide throughout are estimated and are subject to change.\n\nOur estimated time to have power back on is currently between 12:00 and 13:00, but after we arrive and assess the situation this may change. The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",

I just wanted to let you know.; Our team of specialist engineers are now on their way to the Whadden Chase area. Based on what we know about the issue so far, and to allow them time to arrive and make repairs, we've changed the estimated time to between 16:00 and 17:00.\n\nWe're sorry for the delay, but we'll let you know when they arrive and we'll keep you updated with progress. If you have any questions or concerns, our team are always here to help on 105. Sent by David at 10:44.",

However, once they've assessed further we'll let you know if the time frame needs to change.\n\nFor more information about this type of fault; here's a short video https://bit.ly/2ScxQDZ - I'll keep you updated.",

They may also walk our cabling route throughout the area to check for any visible problems, check smaller electrical sites in the area, or apply specialist equipment which may restore power temporarily to help them with their testing.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice.
