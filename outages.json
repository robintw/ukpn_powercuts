We are needing to replace a piece of our electrical equipment due to it coming to the end of its serviceable life. This equipment is known as a linkbox and is essential equipment where our cables connect underground. To ensure our engineers can carry out these works safely we will need to temporarily switch off your power. Once work is completed this will ensure our electricity network is working to the best of its ability and also reduce the possibility of having an unplanned power cut. This work is taking place near Burntwood Lane. Temporary traffic lights will be in place to allow the works to be carried out safely.",

As such, they have replaced our substation equipment to restore power as quickly as possible.\n\nI'm sorry this affected your power again today. This may happen again before we're able to pinpoint the issue and fix it, but if you'd like to talk to us about anything or if your power isn't on, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

They may also walk our cabling route throughout the area to check for any visible problems, check smaller electrical sites in the area, or apply specialist equipment which may restore power temporarily to help them with their testing.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice.

The issue was caused by an unexpected fault with some of our network equipment, which our engineers have now replaced.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

They may also walk our cabling route throughout the area to check for any visible problems, check smaller electrical sites in the area, or apply specialist equipment which may restore power temporarily to help them with their testing.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nWe'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",

There are now only 3 properties without power, who we'll speak to directly. If you're without power and haven't been contacted, then we'll need to hear from you. Please call us on 08003163105 (free from landlines and mobiles).\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the unexpected outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",

By doing this, we've managed to restore power to 2153 customers. There are now 362 properties still affected and using an average time frame we're estimating all power will be on between 17:30 and 18:30, but this may change later depending on what our staff find.\n\nWe'll keep sending SMS updates until everybody is restored.

Our engineers have just called in to advise us they have run into complications with the ongoing work to repair the faulty overhead electrical equipment in the Broad Lane area which is now hindering our progress to restore your power.\n\nUnfortunately, it's going to take us past our current time frame to complete this safely, so we're now working towards between 01:00 and 02:00 to have power back on.\n\nWe can appreciate how frustrating and disruptive being without power can be, and our staff are working as fast as they can. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to speak to our team, but I'll let you know further news as it comes in from site. Sent by David at 00:00.",
