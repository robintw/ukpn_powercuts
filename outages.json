As such, they have replaced our substation equipment to restore power as quickly as possible.\n\nI'm sorry this affected your power again today.

They will start running tests at our substation to see how the local network is operating.\n\nIt's quite common for power to be restored briefly and go off again; this is our engineers using testing equipment to energise different sections of our network - this helps to narrow down any possible issues.\n\nOur cabling network is often broken down by smaller sites, and our staff may also check these to test for any problems, and they may also walk the cabling route to see if there are any signs of malfunction that have appeared on the surface. Our time frame hasn't been adjusted, so for now I'll let you know more news as soon as our staff update us.\n\nSent by Simon at 22:28.",

We know your power may have been off for a long time, we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.\n",

I wanted to let you know that our ground teams have managed to restore some further power, but as they've been hard at work restoring power, we've only just been informed.\n\nThey managed to divert power to a further 89 customers, leaving 69 properties still without electricity. I'm sorry for the delay letting you know, but if your lights are back on you can stop our SMS updates any time; just visit our website here - https://bit.ly/348KOZ3.\n\nI know it must be frustrating if your power is still off, but our staff are making progress and I'll let you know more news as soon as we have it.",

Today's power cut was an unexpected overhead network fault that affected 2203 properties, so I'm sorry that we weren't able to provide you with prior notice. I'm pleased to report our staff have resolved this by diverting power to get your lights back on as soon as possible.\n\nWe contact customers when we are made aware of problems like this, so if you would like to be notified in future let us know here https://bit.ly/3zyHC6L\n\nI personally apologise for the disruption this caused you. We aim to provide a 10/10 service in keeping you updated, so if you'd like to talk to us about anything or are still without power, please call us on 105.",

Our staff are working as quickly as they can to get the lights back on, and they've advised us that there are now 169 properties still affected.\n\nThey have managed to get a further 347 of our customers back on by diverting electricity, so your power may have come on sooner than we originally advised.\n\nIf you're still off, please don't worry; work on the issue will continue along with SMS updates until everyone is back on.\n\nTo stop receiving texts, just follow this link https://bit.ly/348KOZ3 to unsubscribe.",

We know your power may have been off for a long time, we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.",

High voltage cabling can cover a wide area, so sometimes properties very close to you may have had power cuts that you didn't experience.\n\nI know you may not have had any previous power cuts, but if you have, we often get progress updates from our field staff management about investigations into repeat issues, and our Customer Services team will try to contact everyone affected by them to explain what's happening.",

I'm sorry for the power cut today; I know the lights going off can be disruptive.\n\nWe know that some customers affected by todays power cut may have had other issues recently, and I appreciate this is frustrating. High voltage cabling can cover a wide area, so sometimes properties very close to you may have had power cuts that you didn't experience.\n\nI know you may not have had any previous power cuts, but if you have, we often get progress updates from our field staff management about investigations into repeat issues, and our Customer Services team will try to contact everyone affected by them to explain what's happening.",

Our engineers have diverted power around a fault on our overhead network to get the majority of customers back on. However, due to the location and complexity of the issue, we have also used a temporary generator to restore power to the last of the affected properties. This will provide power until our engineers plan in and safely complete the full repair, which may take a few days.\n\nWe're really sorry for any disruption this unexpected power cut caused. If your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",
