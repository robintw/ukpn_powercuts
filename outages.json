        "Comment": "Good morning, this is a message from Harry at UK Power Networks regarding the planned power cut which is currently in progress today the 13th February 2026 in the NR34 postcode area. The power was switched off to enable our contractors to test a piece of equipment called a transformer near Station Road. Our contractors have advised us that the 39 affected properties will be restored early between approximately 10:15 and 10:30. This is due to the works progressing well and being completed ahead of schedule. Once these works are complete this will improve the reliability of the electricity network. Our reference number for this work is INCD-17990-I. I hope that the power coming on earlier is of benefit to you. We always aim to provide a 10/10 service, if you feel we have not delivered you a 10/10 service then please call us on 105.",

The power was switched off to enable our engineers to carry out alterations to an overhead service following a customer request and also to change a transformer near Vauxhall Lane. Our engineers have advised us that the 32 affected properties will be restored early between approximately 14:10 and 14:30. This is due to the works progressing well and being completed ahead of schedule. Once these works are complete this will provide the customer with their desired outcome, as well as improve the reliability of the electricity network. Our reference number for this work is INCD-327312-U. I hope that the power coming on earlier is of benefit to you.

        "Comment": "Good afternoon, this is a message from Harry at UK Power Networks regarding the planned power cut which is currently in progress today the 13th February 2026 in the TN11 postcode area. The power was switched off to enable our engineers to carry out alterations to an overhead service following a customer request and also to change a transformer near Vauxhall Lane. Our engineers have advised us that the 32 affected properties will be restored early between approximately 14:10 and 14:30. This is due to the works progressing well and being completed ahead of schedule. Once these works are complete this will provide the customer with their desired outcome, as well as improve the reliability of the electricity network. Our reference number for this work is INCD-327312-U. I hope that the power coming on earlier is of benefit to you. We always aim to provide a 10/10 service, if you feel we have not delivered you a 10/10 service then please call us on 105.",

        "Comment": "Sent by Aaron at 13:53 - Thank you for your patience while our engineers diverted power around the underground network fault in the Upper Shirley Road area. We have now restored power to all but one property. We're sorry for any disruption this unexpected power cut caused.\n\nIf your power isn't back on, we'd still like to keep you updated. If we aren't currently in contact with you by phone or in person at your property, please call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",

Our engineers have just called in to advise us that they are still awaiting for the temporary generator to arrive on site in the Folkestone CT18 7 area and is now hindering our progress to restore power.\n\nUnfortunately, it's going to take us past our current time frame to complete this safely, so we're now working towards between 17:00 and 18:00 to have power back on.\n\nWe can appreciate how frustrating and disruptive being without power can be, and our staff are working as fast as they can. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to speak to our team, but I'll let you know further news as it comes in from site. Sent by David at 14:50.",
