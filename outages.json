We have now restored power to all but one property. We're sorry for any disruption this unexpected power cut caused. The customer support vehicle has stood down and further repairs will be carried out.\n\nIf your power isn't back on, we'd still like to keep you updated. If we aren't currently in contact with you by phone or in person at your property, please call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power for a long time can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",

To give them time to do this safely, the estimated time frame to restore your power is now between 20:00 and 21:00.\n\nWe're sorry this is taking longer than expected, and we'll continue to keep you up to date, but if any change to this time comes in from our staff I'll let you know as soon as we hear.",
