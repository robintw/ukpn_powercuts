        "Comment": "Sent by Bev at 21:23 - Engineers are on their way. At this point we think the issue is a fault with equipment in your local substation in the Westbury Road area. We didn't know this was going to happen, so time frames we provide throughout are estimated and are subject to change.\n\nOur estimated time to have power back on is currently between 00:30 and 01:30, but after we arrive and assess the situation this may change. The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",

We're arranging staff to attend ASAP, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting electricity. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to get as many customers back on as we can.\n\nOnce available, our engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, they will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will work to locate the issue and make repairs, which may take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing but we'll always give you the clearest information we have.",
