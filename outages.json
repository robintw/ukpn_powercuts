The power was switched off at 09:05 to enable our engineers to carry out tree trimming around our overhead electricity cables near High Easter Road. Our engineers have advised us that the 26 affected properties will be restored early by approx. 14:00 due to the works being completed earlier than planned. Now these works have been completed, this will improve the reliability of the electricity network and reduce the risk of a tree related unplanned power cut in the future. Our reference number for this work is INCD-24325-O. I hope that the power coming on earlier is of benefit to you.

        "Comment": "Good afternoon, this is a message from Sam at UK Power Networks regarding the planned power cut which is in progress today the 11th of February 2026 in the CM1 postcode area. The power was switched off at 09:05 to enable our engineers to carry out tree trimming around our overhead electricity cables near High Easter Road. Our engineers have advised us that the 26 affected properties will be restored early by approx. 14:00 due to the works being completed earlier than planned. Now these works have been completed, this will improve the reliability of the electricity network and reduce the risk of a tree related unplanned power cut in the future. Our reference number for this work is INCD-24325-O. I hope that the power coming on earlier is of benefit to you. We always aim to provide a 10/10 service, if you feel we have not delivered you a 10/10 service then please call us on 105. VB & SMS sent.",

For now we have restored your power as quickly as we can.\n\nIf your power isn't on or you would like to talk to us, call us for free on 08003163105.

They will start running tests at our substation to see how the local network is operating.\n\nIt's quite common for power to be restored briefly and go off again; this is our engineers using testing equipment to energise different sections of our network - this helps to narrow down any possible issues.\n\nOur cabling network is often broken down by smaller sites, and our staff may also check these to test for any problems, and they may also walk the cabling route to see if there are any signs of malfunction that have appeared on the surface. Our time frame hasn't been adjusted, so for now I'll let you know more news as soon as our staff update us.\n\nSent by Talie at 17:20.",

However, this could change once our staff have assessed the local network.\n\nWe believe the power cuts you have been experiencing are caused by a fault with one of the cables. Developing faults can start very small, and so can be hard to detect but each power cut usually makes it easier to see, which means our specialist staff can detect it, and work on the repair to prevent further outages.\n\nI'll let you know once our teams arrive.",
