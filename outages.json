Our engineers have advised us that the 10 affected properties will be restored early between approximately 13:15-13:30 as the works have progressed better than expected. We can confirm that once power has been restored to the area that the works for a third party to trim trees around 1 section of overhead cables near The Ridge will be completed which will adhere to the customer request and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut in the future. Our reference number for this work is INCD-105820-C. I hope that the power coming on earlier is of benefit to you.

        "Comment": "Good afternoon, this is a message from Ryan at UK Power Networks regarding the planned power cut which is currently in progress today the 18th of December 2025 in the CM3 postcode area. Our engineers have advised us that the 10 affected properties will be restored early between approximately 13:15-13:30 as the works have progressed better than expected. We can confirm that once power has been restored to the area that the works for a third party to trim trees around 1 section of overhead cables near The Ridge will be completed which will adhere to the customer request and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut in the future. Our reference number for this work is INCD-105820-C. I hope that the power coming on earlier is of benefit to you. We always aim to provide a 10/10 service, if you feel we have not delivered you a 10/10 service then please call us on 105.",

        "Comment": "Good morning, this is a message from Alicia at UK Power Networks regarding the planned power cut which is currently in progress today the 18th December 2025 in the CB23 postcode area. The power was switched off to enable our engineers to run some essential checks on a piece of equipment called a transformer near Barton Road.  Our engineers have advised us that works have gone well and affected properties will be restored slightly earlier than planned at approximately 11:30. Once power has been restored to the area, this has improved the reliability of the electricity network, ensured the equipment is running to the best of its ability and reduced the risk of you having an unplanned power cut. Our reference number for this work is INCD-105884-C. I hope that the power coming on earlier is of benefit to you. We always aim to provide a 10/10 service, if you feel we have not delivered you a 10/10 service then please call us on 105. Thank you",

We need to examine a transformer on our electricity poles to check it is functioning properly. This essential work helps to provide a reliable electricity supply to your property, reducing the risk of any unplanned power cuts in the future. To keep everyone safe while we carry out these works, we will need to temporarily turn off your electricity. We are taking extra measures to limit the time your power is off and we'll do our best to cause as little disruption as possible. Doing this will improve the reliability of the electricity network in the future as we appreciate you may have been impacted by an unplanned power cut in the last 6 months.

Due to the delay this has caused, they've advised a new time of 14:30-15:30 to have your power back on.\n\nI know another delay is frustrating; our engineers always try to give us the best estimate that they can but due to the safety elements of working with live electricity, sometimes they have to adjust their repairs at short notice.\n\nI'm sorry if this has caused you to change any plans you've made, but we'll be here to update you until the lights are safely back on.",

The issue was caused by an unexpected fault on our underground cables, which our engineers have now been able to repair.\n\nWe know that a power cut can be difficult, and I'm sorry for the length of the time you were without your electricity. Please rest assured that our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

Thanks for bearing with us during the power cut, I know the lights being off is a worry.\n\nOur staff have advised that the excavations were delayed due to a car that was parked on the fault location, which has since been moved. Due to the delay this has caused, they've advised a new time of 14:30-15:30 to have your power back on.\n\nI know another delay is frustrating; our engineers always try to give us the best estimate that they can but due to the safety elements of working with live electricity, sometimes they have to adjust their repairs at short notice.\n\nI'm sorry if this has caused you to change any plans you've made, but we'll be here to update you until the lights are safely back on.",

Our customer services team will keep as many customers updated as possible during these investigations. \n\nWe're sorry for the unplanned disruption.

I'm sorry for the power cut today; I know the lights going off can be disruptive.\n\nWe know that some customers affected by todays power cut may have had other issues recently, and I appreciate this is frustrating. High voltage cabling can cover a wide area, so sometimes properties very close to you may have had power cuts that you didn't experience.\n\nI know you may not have had any previous power cuts, but if you have, we often get progress updates from our field staff management about investigations into repeat issues, and our Customer Services team will try to contact everyone affected by them to explain what's happening.",

Our estimated time to have your power back on is between 22:00 and 23:00, however, this may need to change later depending on how our works progress.\n\nIf you'd like more information about why we sometimes have to switch power off to work; here's a short video https://bit.ly/3cYez0V.

We will keep as many customers updated as possible during these investigations.\n\nTo talk to us, or let us know if your power isn't restored, call us on 105.",

If you have, we're sorry for further disruption. All power cuts are fully investigated by our engineers but can sometimes happen multiple times before we can safely find the issue and fix it.\n\nWe know that not everyone affected by today's power cut will have had other power cuts recently, but we want you to know that if you have, our customer services team will try to update as many customers as possible about our investigations.",

They have advised they may be able to make a cut on a section of the network to restore supplies. Unfortunately, it's going to take us past our current time frame to complete this safely, so we're now working towards between 21:00 and 22:00 to have power back on.\n\nWe can appreciate how frustrating and disruptive being without power can be, and our staff are working as fast as they can.

        "Comment": "Sent by Decasta at 19:51 - Our engineers have now restored power to all 742 customers in the Guildford, GU3 1 area, by diverting power around an underground cabling fault. We know power may have been off for a long time; we're sorry for any disruption this unplanned power cut caused.  \n\nWe know some properties in the area may have faced other recent interruptions, and we're sorry for the extra disruption. Every outage is fully investigated by our engineers, though power may be lost several times before we can safely find and fix the issue. Our customer services team will keep as many customers updated as possible during these investigations.\n\nTo talk to us, or let us know that your power isn't restored, call us on 08003163105.",

We understand how difficult a power cut can be, but we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on.

However, once they update us we'll know if our estimated time frame needs to change and why, and I'll let you know as soon as we hear.\n\nIn the meantime, if we can offer any support or advice, our team are always available to talk on 105.\n\nSent by Decasta at 17:34.",

We're pleased that we have been able to restore power sooner than we estimated.\n\nIf your power isn't back on, we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.",

We know a power cut can be difficult; we're sorry for any disruption this unplanned power cut caused.  \n\nWe know some properties in the area may have faced other recent interruptions, and we're sorry for the extra disruption. Every outage is fully investigated by our engineers, though power may be lost several times before we can safely find and fix the issue. Our customer services team will keep as many customers updated as possible during these investigations.\n\nTo talk to us, or let us know that your power isn't restored, call us on 08003163105.",

To stop SMS updates, visit our website here - https://bit.ly/348KOZ3.\n\nIf your power is still affected, our engineers have been in touch to advise they have found a tree resting on the overhead cabling which they are working to remove.

We believe the issue is an underground network fault that initially interrupted power to 3531 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 608 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 21:30 and 22:30, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

Today's power cut was an unexpected overhead network fault that affected 601 properties, so I'm sorry that we weren't able to provide you with prior notice. I'm pleased to report our staff have resolved this by diverting power to get your lights back on as soon as possible.\n\nWe contact customers when we are made aware of problems like this, so if you would like to be notified in future let us know here https://bit.ly/3zyHC6L\n\nI personally apologise for the disruption this caused you. We aim to provide a 10/10 service in keeping you updated, so if you'd like to talk to us about anything or are still without power, please call us on 105.",

We're pleased that we have been able to restore power sooner than we estimated.\n\nIf your power isn't back on, we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on.

We believe the issue is an overhead network fault that initially interrupted power to 601 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 282 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 22:00 and 23:00, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

We're arranging staff to attend ASAP, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting electricity. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to get as many customers back on as we can.\n\nOnce available, our engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, they will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will work to locate the issue and make repairs, which may take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing but we'll always give you the clearest information we have.",

Thanks for your patience today, our field staff and control room engineers are working to get your power back on as quickly as they can.\n\nOur records show that some properties affected by today's power cut may have had other unexpected interruptions recently. If you have, we're sorry for further disruption. All power cuts are fully investigated by our engineers but can sometimes happen multiple times before we can safely find the issue and fix it.\n\nWe know that not everyone affected by today's power cut will have had other power cuts recently, but we want you to know that if you have, our customer services team will try to update as many customers as possible about our investigations.",

At this point we think the issue is an overhead network fault affecting 268 properties.\n\nSpecialist engineers from our control room are also working to divert power remotely, so it's possible your power could come back on at any point. We can't always restore everyone this way. That's why we're also sending staff to the area to check our equipment.\n\nEvery fault is different, so our time frames have to be estimated but currently we hope to have power back on between 22:30 and 23:30. We must stress that it may become necessary for this to change, depending on what our engineers find.\n\nWe'll keep you updated with our progress.",

We're arranging staff to attend ASAP, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting electricity. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to get as many customers back on as we can.\n\nOnce available, our engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, they will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will work to locate the issue and make repairs, which may take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing but we'll always give you the clearest information we have.",
