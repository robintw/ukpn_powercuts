We've now restored power to most of the affected properties by safely connecting temporary generators to our network. There are now only 3 properties without power, who we'll speak to directly. If you're without power and haven't been contacted, then we'll need to hear from you. Please call us on 08003163105 (free from landlines and mobiles).\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the unexpected outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",

        "Comment": "Sent by Stuart at 21:18 - We believe our engineers have been able to restore power to all 3390 customers in the Bromley, BR1 area, by diverting power around an underground cable fault. This means we have been able to restore power sooner than we anticipated, but we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.",
