        "Comment": "I appreciate your continued patience this morning. We want to be as transparent as possible as we know having multiple power cuts is disruptive and worrying, so I would like to help explain why we can't always fix a problem like this right away.\n\nUnderground electricity cabling is insulated for safety and if a fault develops, these materials can re-seal due to heat passing through them when our safety equipment operates and your power is lost. This covers any potential fault again, meaning our staff cannot locate it using their tests or specialist equipment.\n\nWe'll know more once our staff contact us again, so I'll be in touch again shortly.\n\nSent by Lee at 08:31.",

They will start running tests at our substation to see how the local network is operating.\n\nIt's quite common for power to be restored briefly and go off again; this is our engineers using testing equipment to energise different sections of our network - this helps to narrow down any possible issues.\n\nOur cabling network is often broken down by smaller sites, and our staff may also check these to test for any problems, and they may also walk the cabling route to see if there are any signs of malfunction that have appeared on the surface. Our time frame hasn't been adjusted, so for now I'll let you know more news as soon as our staff update us.\n\nSent by Lee at 08:09.",

For now we have restored your power as quickly as we can.\n\nIf your power isn't on or you would like to talk to us, call us for free on 08003163105. We know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",

They will start running tests at our substation to see how the local network is operating.\n\nIt's quite common for power to be restored briefly and go off again; this is our engineers using testing equipment to energise different sections of our network - this helps to narrow down any possible issues.\n\nOur cabling network is often broken down by smaller sites, and our staff may also check these to test for any problems, and they may also walk the cabling route to see if there are any signs of malfunction that have appeared on the surface. Our time frame hasn't been adjusted, so for now I'll let you know more news as soon as our staff update us.\n\nSent by Bev at 09:31.",

However, this could change once our staff have assessed the local network.\n\nWe believe the power cuts you have been experiencing are caused by a fault with one of the cables. Developing faults can start very small, and so can be hard to detect but each power cut usually makes it easier to see, which means our specialist staff can detect it, and work on the repair to prevent further outages.\n\nI'll let you know once our teams arrive.",

They were able to divert power around the faulty underground cables in the SG8 7, SG8 5 area. We're sorry for any disruption this unexpected power cut caused.\n\nIf your power isn't back on, we'd still like to keep you updated. If we aren't currently in contact with you by phone or in person at your property, please call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",

We've had an update from our staff that there are now 450 properties still affected by the underground cable fault as they have managed to safely divert some power, getting the lights back on for 1393 of our customers.\n\nWe'll keep sending text updates to everyone until all the power to your area is on.

We believe the issue is an underground cable fault that initially interrupted power to 3592 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 1843 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 1330 -1430 but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

Our team of cable jointers have now identified the suspected section of faulted underground cabling using their specialist equipment.\n\nOur digging team will now begin excavations, and this can take some time depending on the surface material, and how much space is needed to allow our engineers to assess the fault and make their repairs safely. \n\nOur estimated time frame of 22:00 and 23:00 doesn't need to change currently. We'll continue to keep you updated, but our team are always here if you have any questions.",

Today's power cut was unexpected, so we were unable to provide you with prior notice to help you plan ahead.

Today's power cut was unexpected, so we were unable to provide you with prior notice to help you plan ahead. I am pleased to confirm that we managed to resolve this by diverting power to get your lights back on as soon as possible.\n\nJust so you know, we text customers when we are made aware of problems like this, so if you would like to be notified in the future you can do so here https://bit.ly/3zyHC6L.\n\nThis was a widespread problem on the overhead network and I personally apologise for any disruption this has caused to your day. If you have any questions or are still without power, please call us on 105.",

They have diverted power around an overhead cable fault.\n\nWe know some properties in the area may have faced other recent interruptions, and we're sorry for the extra disruption. Every outage is fully investigated by our engineers, though power may be lost several times before we can safely find and fix the issue. Our customer services team will keep as many customers updated as possible during these investigations. \n\nWe're sorry for the unplanned disruption. If you need to talk to us, or let us know that your power isn't restored, call us on 08003163105.\n",

We have already sent staff to the area, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting the electricity around the faulty section. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will locate and repair the issue, which will take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",
