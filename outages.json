        "Comment": "Good afternoon, this is a message from Ryan at UK Power Networks regarding the planned power cut which is currently in progress today the 17th of February 2026 in the TN14 postcode area. Our contractors have advised us that the 11 affected properties will be restored early in stages between approximately 15:00-16:30 as the works are progressing well. We can confirm that once power has been restored to the area that the works to replace and upgrade 5 sections of cables and 13 poles on Coopers Corner will be completed which will improve the reliability of the network and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut in the future. Our reference number for this work is INCD-433726-G. I hope that the power coming on earlier is of benefit to you. We always aim to provide a 10/10 service, if you feel we have not delivered you a 10/10 service then please call us on 105.",

For now we have restored your power as quickly as we can.\n\nIf your power isn't on or you would like to talk to us, call us for free on 08003163105. We know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",

However, this could change once our staff have assessed the local network.\n\nWe believe the power cuts you have been experiencing are caused by a fault with one of the cables. Developing faults can start very small, and so can be hard to detect but each power cut usually makes it easier to see, which means our specialist staff can detect it, and work on the repair to prevent further outages.\n\nI'll let you know once our teams arrive.",

        "Comment": "Great news - Our engineers have now restored power to all 1767  customers in the Abridge RM4 1 area by diverting power around the fault on our overhead cables.\n\nThank you for your patience while our engineers worked hard to resolve this complex issue safely. We apologise that we had to change our time for restoration during the power cut, and we appreciate your understanding.\n\nIf your power isn't back on, we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nSent by Roland at 14:21",

For now we have restored your power as quickly as we can.\n\nIf your power isn't on or you would like to talk to us, call us for free on 08003163105. We know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",

        "Comment": "We're sorry your power has gone off again.\n\nWe believe there may be an underlying issue causing the recent power cuts, but due to the nature of the electricity network, the heat created by a developing fault can cause a break in a cable to reseal itself. This can make it difficult to locate, so while our engineers are testing our equipment thoroughly to pinpoint the issue, this kind of problem may interrupt power multiple times before it's possible for us to fix.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nI'll keep you updated. Sent by Donny at 11:11.",

They will then check our network equipment throughout the area to try and identify any problems, before trying to restore power.\n\nOur estimated time frame of 13:00-14:00 hasn't changed, but if this is not successful it's possible that a cable repair may be needed. This can involve ground excavations, traffic management equipment or specialist teams. As soon as our staff can safely update us, we'll give you the latest news. Sent by Donny at 10:55.\n",

Originally, we believed this issue to be a network fault, but we have been made aware that we have some potentially faulty overhead cabling, so our engineers have turned power off in the interest of public safety. We don't have an estimated time frame just yet but as soon as we do, we will let you know.\n\nInitially, 825 properties were affected. However, we have diverted power to part of the area, so 20 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers will continue to divert power remotely if possible, so your electricity may come back on at any point.\n\nPower back on?

For now we have restored your power as quickly as we can.\n\nIf your power isn't on or you would like to talk to us, call us for free on 08003163105. We know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",

We are sending our engineers back to the Central Parade area to investigate why.\n\nCurrently, our time frame for power to be restored is between 18:00 and 19:00, but once our staff arrive on site and assess the situation, this time may change. As there have been other power cuts recently it's difficult to know what repairs will be needed to restore your power safely, so time frames we provide throughout have to be estimated.\n\nThe results of our engineer's tests on our network will let us know if our estimate needs to be adjusted, so we'll update you as soon as they have arrived on site and investigated.",
