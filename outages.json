We have now restored power to all but one property. We're sorry for any disruption this unexpected power cut caused.\n\nIf your power isn't back on, we'd still like to keep you updated. If we aren't currently in contact with you by phone or in person at your property, please call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage.

It's possible they will still be able to restore your power within the current time frame using other methods, but it's also possible our time frame will need to change.\n\nI'll let you know further news as soon as we get it, but if you have any concerns our team are always here on 08003163105.
