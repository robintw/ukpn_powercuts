I'm sorry for any disruption we caused by having to turn off your power to repair an unexpected fault on our underground cabling network.\n\nWe'd still like to keep you informed if your electricity hasn't been restored. Please call us free any time on 08003163105 if we haven't already reached out to you by phone or in person at your property.\n\nWe apologise for the outage and understand that being without power can be challenging. Rest assured that our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep your lights on.",

Because of this, I apologise in advance if I make any mistakes with spelling or grammar; we're only human!\n\nI know that it's dark and that will be especially worrying, but both our field teams and our contact centre work 24 hours a day, so for now, I hope you're doing okay and I'll let you know as soon as we have some more news.",

Our estimated time to have your power back on is between 00:30 and 01:30, however, this may need to change later depending on how our works progress.\n\nIf you'd like more information about why we sometimes have to switch power off to work; here's a short video https://bit.ly/3cYez0V.

Every outage is fully investigated by our engineers, though power may be lost several times before we can safely find and fix the issue. Our customer services team will keep as many customers updated as possible during these investigations. \n\nWe're sorry for the unplanned disruption.

A specialist team are on the way and to give them time to make the repairs safely, the estimated time frame to restore your power is now between 03:30 and 04:30.\n\nWe're sorry this is taking longer than expected, and we'll continue to keep you up to date, but if any change to this time comes in from our staff I'll let you know as soon as we hear.",

They may also walk our cabling route throughout the area to check for any visible problems, check smaller electrical sites in the area, or apply specialist equipment which may restore power temporarily to help them with their testing.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nWe'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",

Thanks for bearing with us during the power cut, I know the lights being off is a worry.\n\nOur staff have advised that to restore power we need to isolate power to further properties so that we can work on repairs and connect a temporary generator. Due to the delay this has caused, they've advised a new time of 11:30 and 12:30 to have your power back on.\n\nI know another delay is frustrating; our engineers always try to give us the best estimate that they can but due to the safety elements of working with live electricity, sometimes they have to adjust their repairs at short notice.\n\nI'm sorry if this has caused you to change any plans you've made, but we'll be here to update you until the lights are safely back on.",

Due to there being multiple power cuts over a short space of time, our engineers are going to be testing if the network is still healthy.\n\nThey will start at the substation, and often apply specialist equipment that may turn your power back on for a brief period, so don't worry if your power comes on and goes off again. They will also check smaller sites which run along our cabling route, these break our network down into smaller sections and can help pinpoint any possible problems.\n\nOur estimated time frame of 11:30 - 12:30 hasn't changed, so I'll let you know more once our staff update us.

This is because every power cut increases the chance of the fault has developing to a point that our specialist teams can pinpoint it using specialist equipment.
