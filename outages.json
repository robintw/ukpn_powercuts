The power was switched off to enable our contractors to replace and upgrade a piece of equipment called a transformer near Gutteridge Hall Lane. Our contractors have advised us that the 15 affected properties will be restored early between approximately 11:00 and 11:30. This is due to the works progressing well on site, meaning that the works can be completed ahead of schedule. Once these works are complete this will improve the reliability of the electricity network and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut. Our reference number for this work is INCD-23845-O. I hope that the power coming on earlier is of benefit to you.

        "Comment": "Good morning, this is a message from Harry at UK Power Networks regarding the planned power cut which is currently in progress today the 25th November 2025 in the CO16 postcode area. The power was switched off to enable our contractors to replace and upgrade a piece of equipment called a transformer near Gutteridge Hall Lane. Our contractors have advised us that the 15 affected properties will be restored early between approximately 11:00 and 11:30. This is due to the works progressing well on site, meaning that the works can be completed ahead of schedule. Once these works are complete this will improve the reliability of the electricity network and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut. Our reference number for this work is INCD-23845-O. I hope that the power coming on earlier is of benefit to you. We always aim to provide a 10/10 service, if you feel we have not delivered you a 10/10 service then please call us on 105.",

They may also walk our cabling route throughout the area to check for any visible problems, check smaller electrical sites in the area, or apply specialist equipment which may restore power temporarily to help them with their testing.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice.

For now we have restored your power as quickly as we can.\n\nIf your power isn't on or you would like to talk to us, call us for free on 08003163105.

Due to there being multiple power cuts over a short space of time, our engineers are going to start their tests at the nearby substation.\n\nOur current time frame is between 14:30 and 15:30; this is an estimate based on them checking the state of our network, and attempting to restore your power.\n\nIt's possible that the underground cabling fault we believe has been causing these power cuts has reach a point where they can't safely replace our substation equipment. If this happens we'll need to arrange further teams and equipment, so I'll let you know more news as soon as our staff update us. Sent by Adam at 11:09.",
