The power was switched off to enable our contractors to test a piece of equipment called a transformer to ensure that it is functioning properly. Our contractors have advised us that the 42 affected properties will be restored early between approximately 10:25 and 10:45. This is due to better accessibility on site meaning that the works are progressing well and being completed ahead of schedule. Once these works are complete this will improve the reliability of the electricity network. Our reference number for this work is INCD-326716-U. I hope that the power coming on earlier is of benefit to you. We always aim to provide a 10/10 service, if you feel we have not delivered you a 10/10 service then please call us on 105.",

        "Comment": "Good morning, this is a message from Harry at UK Power Networks regarding the planned power cut which is currently in progress today the 13th November 2025 in the TN25 postcode area. The power was switched off to enable our contractors to test a piece of equipment called a transformer to ensure that it is functioning properly. Our contractors have advised us that the 42 affected properties will be restored early between approximately 10:25 and 10:45. This is due to better accessibility on site meaning that the works are progressing well and being completed ahead of schedule. Once these works are complete this will improve the reliability of the electricity network. Our reference number for this work is INCD-326716-U. I hope that the power coming on earlier is of benefit to you. We always aim to provide a 10/10 service, if you feel we have not delivered you a 10/10 service then please call us on 105.",

        "Comment": "Good morning, this is a message from Harry at UK Power Networks regarding the planned power cut which is currently in progress today the 13th November 2025 in the ME9 postcode area. The power was switched off to enable our contractors to test a piece of equipment called a transformer to ensure it is functioning properly. Our contractors have advised us that the 28 affected properties will be restored early between approximately 10:45 and 11:00. This is due to the works progressing well and being completed ahead of schedule. Once these works are complete this will improve the reliability of the electricity network. Our reference number for this work is INCD-326717-U. I hope that the power coming on earlier is of benefit to you. We always aim to provide a 10/10 service, if you feel we have not delivered you a 10/10 service then please call us on 105.",

The power was switched off at 09:00 by our engineers to enable a third party to carry out tree trimming safely around our overhead electricity cables in Lidgate. Our engineers have advised us that works have gone well, and the 36 affected properties will be restored early at approximately 13:50. Once completed and power have been restored to the area it has reduced the possibility of you having an unplanned power cut by stopping these trees from potentially causing damage to our overhead electricity network and have given the third party their desired outcome.

This has identified overhead cables that need replacing and upgrading and a transformer that needs upgrading. To avoid a further planned power cut, we will also be trimming trees around our overhead cables. To ensure our engineers can carry out this work safely we will need to temporarily switch off your power. Doing this will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut in the future as we appreciate some customers may have experienced unplanned power cuts in the last 6 months. This work is taking place near Barhams Mill Road. A road closure will be in place to allow the works to be carried out safely. Access to your property will always be provided.",

This essential work helps to provide a reliable electricity supply to your property, reducing the risk of any unplanned power cuts in the future, as we understand some customers may have experienced 5 unplanned power cuts in the last 6 months. To keep everyone safe while we carry out these works, we will need to temporarily turn off your electricity. We are taking extra measures to limit the time your power is off and we'll do our best to cause as little disruption as possible. Doing this will improve the reliability of the electricity network in the future. This work is taking place on Swanborough Drove.",

        "Comment": "Sent by Simon at 22:10 - Our engineers are on their way. We believe the issue is an overhead network fault that initially interrupted power to 1581 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 670 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 00:00-01:00, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

We're arranging staff to attend ASAP, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting electricity. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to get as many customers back on as we can.\n\nOnce available, our engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, they will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will work to locate the issue and make repairs, which may take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing but we'll always give you the clearest information we have.",

They will then check our network equipment throughout the area to try and identify any problems, before trying to restore power.\n\nOur estimated time frame of 01:30-02:30 hasn't changed, but if this is not successful it's possible that a cable repair may be needed.

As there have been other power cuts recently it's difficult to know what repairs will be needed to restore your power safely, so time frames we provide throughout have to be estimated.\n\nThe results of our engineer's tests on our network will let us know if our estimate needs to be adjusted, so we'll update you as soon as they have arrived on site and investigated.",

Following the results of their tests, the underground cable fault we believe is causing these issues has not yet become visible, so for the moment we have restored your power as fast as possible.\n\nI'm very sorry for the continued disruption, but this may happen again before we're able to fix it.

        "Comment": "Sent by Roland at 14:03 - We believe our engineers have been able to restore power to all 1208 customers in the Watford and Rickmansworth areas, by diverting power around the underground network fault. This means we have been able to restore power sooner than we anticipated, we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.",
