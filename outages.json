        "Comment": "Our engineers have arrived on site in the BN5 9/BN6 9 area to investigate the power cut affecting 46 properties.\n\nSpecialist engineers are also working to divert power remotely, and this can cause your lights to go on and off.\n\nWe know that a power cut can be very disruptive; we understand this can greatly impact your daily activities and we want to support you however we can. We'll update you with all of our progress but if you need to speak to us, call our team on 08003163105 any time. Sent by Aaron at 20:53.",

Every outage is fully investigated by our engineers, though power may be lost several times before we can safely find and fix the issue. Our customer services team will keep as many customers updated as possible during these investigations. \n\nWe're sorry for the unplanned disruption.

As such, they have replaced our substation equipment to restore power as quickly as possible.\n\nI'm sorry this affected your power again today. This may happen again before we're able to pinpoint the issue and fix it, but if you'd like to talk to us about anything or if your power isn't on, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

We'll update you with all of our progress but if you need to speak to us, call our team on 08003163105 any time. Sent by Will at 00:59.",

We've had an update from our staff that there are now 237 properties still affected by the overhead network fault, as they have managed to safely divert some power, getting the lights back on for 240 of our customers.\n\nWe'll keep sending text updates to everyone until all the power to your area is on.

We have already sent staff to the area, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting the electricity around the faulty section. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will locate and repair the issue, which will take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",
