Thanks for bearing with us during the power cut, I know the lights being off is a worry.\n\nOur staff have advised that that the repair work is proving to be more complex than previously anticipated and as a result, we may need to turn off more power to enable safe repairs. Due to the delay this has caused, they've advised a new time of 01:00-02:00 to have your power back on.\n\nI know another delay is frustrating; our engineers always try to give us the best estimate that they can but due to the safety elements of working with live electricity, sometimes they have to adjust their repairs at short notice.\n",

Thanks for your patience today, our field staff and control room engineers are working/ to get your power back on as quickly as they can.\n\nOur records show that some properties affected by today's power cut may have had other unexpected interruptions recently. If you have, we're sorry for further disruption. All power cuts are fully investigated by our engineers but can sometimes happen multiple times before we can safely find the issue and fix it.\n\nWe know that not everyone affected by today's power cut will have had other power cuts recently, but we want you to know that if you have, our customer services team will try to update as many customers as possible about our investigations.",

By doing this, we've managed to restore power to 630 customers. There are now 923 properties still affected.\n\nWe'll keep sending SMS updates until everybody is restored.

We have already sent staff to the area, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting the electricity around the faulty section. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will locate and repair the issue, which will take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",

At this point we think the issue is on our overhead network affecting 1553 properties.\n\nSpecialist engineers from our control room are also working to divert power remotely, so it's possible your power could come back on at any point. We can't always restore everyone this way. That's why we're also sending staff to the area to check our equipment.\n\nEvery fault is different, so our time frames have to be estimated but currently we hope to have power back on between 14:00 and 15:00. We must stress that it may become necessary for this to change, depending on what our engineers find.\n\nWe'll keep you updated with our progress.",

        "Comment": "Sent by Kevin at 12:36 - Engineers are on their way. At this point we think the issue is a fault with equipment in your local substation in the Wheat Knoll area. We didn't know this was going to happen, so time frames we provide throughout are estimated and are subject to change.\n\nOur estimated time to have power back on is currently between 16:30 and 17:30, but after we arrive and assess the situation this may change. The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",
