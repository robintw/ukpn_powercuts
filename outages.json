We believe our engineers have been able to restore power to all 355 customers in the Great Melton Road area, by repairing and re-erecting the overhead cables that were found laying on the ground. We know your power may have been off for a long time, we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on.
