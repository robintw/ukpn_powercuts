We have already sent staff to the area, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting the electricity around the faulty section. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will locate and repair the issue, which will take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",

This means we have been able to restore power sooner than we anticipated, but we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.\n",

This essential work helps to provide a reliable electricity supply to your property, reducing the risk of any unplanned power cuts in the future as we appreciate your area has been impacted with unplanned power cuts in the last 6 months. To keep everyone safe while we carry out these works, we will need to temporarily turn off your electricity. We are taking extra measures to limit the time your power is off and we'll do our best to cause as little disruption as possible. Doing this will improve the reliability of the electricity network in the future. This work is taking place on a track just off Norwich Road.",

Our engineers have diverted power around an underground network fault to get the majority of customers back on. However, due to the location and complexity of the issue, we have also used a temporary generator to restore power to the last of the affected properties. This will provide power until our engineers plan in and safely complete the full repair, which may take a few days.\n\nWe're really sorry for any disruption this unexpected power cut caused. If your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n",

This essential work helps to provide a reliable electricity supply to your property, reducing the risk of any unplanned power cuts in the future as we appreciate your area has been impacted with unplanned power cuts in the last 6 months. To keep everyone safe while we carry out these works, we will need to temporarily turn off your electricity. We are taking extra measures to limit the time your power is off and we'll do our best to cause as little disruption as possible. Doing this will improve the reliability of the electricity network in the future. This work is taking place in two locations near Steam Mill Road.",
