The issue was caused by an unexpected fault with some of our network equipment, which our engineers have now replaced.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

They may also walk our cabling route throughout the area to check for any visible problems, check smaller electrical sites in the area, or apply specialist equipment which may restore power temporarily to help them with their testing.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nWe'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",

This can make it difficult to locate, so while our engineers are testing our equipment thoroughly to pinpoint the issue, this kind of problem may interrupt power multiple times before it's possible for us to fix.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nI'll keep you updated. Sent by Adam at 13:13",

They have diverted power around an underground cable fault..\n\nWe know some properties in the area may have faced other recent interruptions, and we're sorry for the extra disruption. Every outage is fully investigated by our engineers, though power may be lost several times before we can safely find and fix the issue. Our customer services team will keep as many customers updated as possible during these investigations. \n\nWe're sorry for the unplanned disruption. If you need to talk to us, or let us know that your power isn't restored, call us on 08003163105.",

Our engineers have now investigated the overhead cable that had come down on the ground, and have deemed it safe to restore power back to all 237 properties in the Battle TN33 area.\n\nWe're very sorry we had to turn your power off unexpectedly, and with so little warning. We usually provide much more notice if we can, but in a situation like this our first priority is the safety of the public and our staff.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. If your power is still off or if you have any questions, call our team on 08003163105.",

Our engineers have turned off the power in the Battle TN33 area in the interest of the public's health and safety. This is so they can investigate reports of a an overhead cable that is on the ground.\n\nIf in the area, please take care and stay at least 10m away from the cable. \n\nUntil our engineers arrive on site and investigate, it's difficult to advise you a time frame. However, based on an average for this kind of issue, our estimated time to have you back on is between 18:00 and 19:00. \n\nWe'll keep you updated with our progress, but in the meantime our team are always here to talk on 105 if you have any questions or concerns.",

We didn't know this was going to happen, so time frames we provide throughout are estimated and are subject to change.\n\nOur estimated time to have power back on is currently between 00:00 and 01:00, but after we arrive and assess the situation this may change. The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",

We've had an update from our staff that there are now 40 properties still affected by the underground cable fault, as they have managed to safely divert some power, getting the lights back on for 16 of our customers.\n\nWe'll keep sending text updates to everyone until all the power to your area is on.

We have already sent staff to the area, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting the electricity around the faulty section. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will locate and repair the issue, which will take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",

We believe the issue is an underground network fault that initially interrupted power to 291 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 56 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 23:30-00:30, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

Our engineers investigated the fault earlier but it seems there may be a bigger underlying issue which is causing our substation equipment to operate repeatedly.\n\nOur engineers will be back on site as quickly as possible and using an average time frame, we are currently still aiming to have all power back on between 00:30 and 01:30. We'll keep you updated with all of our progress.",
