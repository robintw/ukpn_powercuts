I'll be on hand to update you as our staff work on repairs, and I just wanted to give you the latest from site.\n\nOur staff have been in contact with us and advised they need assistance from further staff. They are working to check smaller sites along our network, known as link boxes. These have very heavy metal lids, and for safety our engineer needs further staff to help.\n\nOur estimated time frame of 16:00-17:00 hasn't changed.

        "Comment": "We're sorry your power has gone off again.\n\nWe believe there may be an underlying issue causing the recent power cuts, but due to the nature of the electricity network, the heat created by a developing fault can cause a break in a cable to reseal itself. This can make it difficult to locate, so while our engineers are testing our equipment thoroughly to pinpoint the issue, this kind of problem may interrupt power multiple times before it's possible for us to fix.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nI'll keep you updated. Sent by Decasta at 13:24",
