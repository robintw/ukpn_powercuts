Our engineers have further investigated and found that the power is off due to a fault on our underground electricity network which has affected our substation equipment, and a specialist team are on site to pinpoint the fault and dig down to expose the cabling for repairs.\n\nConsidering the work that may be required, the revised estimated time to have the power back on is between 14:00 and 15:00.\n\nWe're sorry to change the time, but we'll keep you updated with our progress.

At this point we think the issue is a 3rd party damage affecting 1208 properties.\n\nSpecialist engineers from our control room are also working to divert power remotely, so it's possible your power could come back on at any point. We can't always restore everyone this way. That's why we're also sending staff to the area to check our equipment.\n\nEvery fault is different, so our time frames have to be estimated but currently we hope to have power back on between 13:30 and 14:30. We must stress that it may become necessary for this to change, depending on what our engineers find.\n\nWe'll keep you updated with our progress.",

We've had an update from our staff that there are now 376 properties still affected by a 3rd party damage to our overhead network cables, as they have managed to safely divert some power, getting the lights back on for 832 of our customers.\n\nWe'll keep sending text updates to everyone until all the power to your area is on.

They may also walk our cabling route throughout the area to check for any visible problems, check smaller electrical sites in the area, or apply specialist equipment which may restore power temporarily to help them with their testing.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nWe'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",

Please accept our sincere apology as we know that it is difficult to be without power for a longer duration.\n\nIf your power isn't back on, we'll need to hear from you. To talk to us about this or anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles. We're really sorry for any disruption this caused.",

We have already sent staff to the area, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting the electricity around the faulty section. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will locate and repair the issue, which will take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",

The power was switched off to enable our contractors to complete maintenance works on a piece of equipment called a transformer near New Road. Our contractors have advised us that the 43 affected properties will be restored early between approximately 10:20 and 10:45. This is due to good accessibility on site meaning that the works have progressed well and can be completed ahead of schedule. Once these works are complete this will improve the reliability of the electricity network. Our reference number for this work is INCD-97063-V.

The power was switched off to enable our contractors to complete maintenance works on a piece of equipment called a transformer near New Road. Our contractors have advised us that the 43 affected properties will be restored early between approximately 10:20 and 10:45.

We can't always restore everyone this way. That's why we're also sending staff to the area to check our equipment.\n\nEvery fault is different, so our time frames have to be estimated but currently we hope to have power back on between 12:30 and 13:30.

        "Comment": "Sent by Bradley  at 10:30 - We believe our engineers have been able to restore power to all 1367 customers in the Slapton area, by faulty overhead network safety equipment. This means we have been able to restore power sooner than we anticipated, we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.",

We've had an update from our staff that there are now 142 properties still affected by the faulty overhead network equipment, as they have managed to safely divert some power, getting the lights back on for 1225 of our customers.\n\nWe'll keep sending text updates to everyone until all the power to your area is on.

        "Comment": "Sent by Bradley  at 10:04 - Our engineers are on their way. At this point we think the issue is faulted overhead network equipment affecting 1225 properties.\n\nSpecialist engineers from our control room are also working to divert power remotely, so it's possible your power could come back on at any point. We can't always restore everyone this way. That's why we're also sending staff to the area to check our equipment.\n\nEvery fault is different, so our time frames have to be estimated but currently we hope to have power back on between 12:30 and 13:30. We must stress that it may become necessary for this to change, depending on what our engineers find.\n\nWe'll keep you updated with our progress.",
