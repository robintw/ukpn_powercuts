This has identified trees that have grown close, which could damage the cables and affect your electricity supply. This work will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut in the future as we appreciate you may have been impacted by unplanned power cuts in the last 6 months. Our engineers need to safely cut the trees away from the cables. During this time, you will be connected to a generator to provide you with electricity whilst we carry out the works. To connect and disconnect the generator we will need to switch off your power temporarily.This work is taking place behind Wellers Town Road",
