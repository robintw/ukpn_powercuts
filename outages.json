This has identified cables and 6 poles that need replacing and upgrading. We will also be carrying out some tree trimming. Doing this will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut in the future. To complete the work safely, we need to turn your power off to upgrade the equipment. To ensure the power is off for the shortest possible time, our engineers may carry out preparation works prior to the power cut. This work is taking place in Shipdham Road in Carbrooke. A road closure will be in place to allow the work to be carried out safely.",

There are now only 5 properties without power, who we'll speak to directly. If you're without power and haven't been contacted, then we'll need to hear from you. Please call us on 08003163105 (free from landlines and mobiles).\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the unexpected outage and how long you may have been off for. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",
