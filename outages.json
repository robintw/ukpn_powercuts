We didn't know this was going to happen, so time frames we provide throughout are estimated and are subject to change.\n\nOur estimated time to have power back on is currently between 20:00 and 21:00, but after we arrive and assess the situation this may change. The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",

We didn't know this was going to happen, so time frames we provide throughout are estimated and are subject to change.\n\nOur estimated time to have power back on is currently between 14:30 and 15:30, but after we arrive and assess the situation this may change. The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",

        "Comment": "Sent by Luke at 13:34 - We believe our engineers have been able to restore power to all 7859 customers in the Southend area, by diverting power around the high voltage fault. This means we have been able to restore power sooner than we anticipated, we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.\n",

Thanks for your patience today, our field staff and control room engineers have worked to get your power back on as quickly as they can.\n\nOur records show that some properties affected by today's power cut may have had other unexpected interruptions recently. If you have, we're sorry for further disruption. All power cuts are fully investigated by our engineers but can sometimes happen multiple times before we can safely find the issue and fix it.\n\nWe know that not everyone affected by today's power cut will have had other power cuts recently, but we want you to know that if you have, our customer services team will try to update as many customers as possible about our investigations.",

In addition to this, they are liaising closely with our control room to find safe and reliable ways to divert power around any problems and get everyone restored.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them. We'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",

We believe there may be a fault on our underground electricity cabling in the area, but currently it has not developed to a stage that our staff can pinpoint it. Their tests have proven inconclusive, so for now they have replaced our safety equipment at the substation to get your power back on as quickly as possible.\n\nThis may happen again before we're able to fix it, but if you'd like to talk to us about this, or if your power isn't on call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

They will start running tests at our substation to see how the local network is operating.\n\nIt's quite common for power to be restored briefly and go off again; this is our engineers using testing equipment to energise different sections of our network - this helps to narrow down any possible issues.\n\nOur cabling network is often broken down by smaller sites, and our staff may also check these to test for any problems, and they may also walk the cabling route to see if there are any signs of malfunction that have appeared on the surface. Our time frame hasn't been adjusted, so for now I'll let you know more news as soon as our staff update us.\n\nSent by Stuart at 05:28.",

This is because every power cut increases the chance of the fault has developing to a point that our specialist teams can pinpoint it using specialist equipment.

We are sending our engineers back to the Elliott Close area to investigate why.\n\nCurrently, our time frame for power to be restored is between 19:00 and 20:00, but once our staff arrive on site and assess the situation, this time may change. As there have been other power cuts recently it's difficult to know what repairs will be needed to restore your power safely, so time frames we provide throughout have to be estimated.\n\nThe results of our engineer's tests on our network will let us know if our estimate needs to be adjusted, so we'll update you as soon as they have arrived on site and investigated.",

Our engineers have advised that the planned power cut has been aborted. This is due to unforeseen network issues meaning that our engineers cannot safely isolate the network for the works to be completed. We now estimate to restore your power between 14:30 and 15:00. These works may be re-scheduled to a later date and affected customers will be notified nearer the time. Our reference number for this is INCD-560611-Z. We would like to apologise for any inconvenience this may cause you. If you have any questions or you have moved from the NR18 postcode area, then please give us a call on 105.",

        "Comment": "Sent by Bradley  at 10:30 - We believe our engineers have been able to restore power to all 1367 customers in the Slapton area, by faulty overhead network safety equipment. This means we have been able to restore power sooner than we anticipated, we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.",

We've had an update from our staff that there are now 142 properties still affected by the faulty overhead network equipment, as they have managed to safely divert some power, getting the lights back on for 1225 of our customers.\n\nWe'll keep sending text updates to everyone until all the power to your area is on.

        "Comment": "Sent by Bradley  at 10:04 - Our engineers are on their way. At this point we think the issue is faulted overhead network equipment affecting 1225 properties.\n\nSpecialist engineers from our control room are also working to divert power remotely, so it's possible your power could come back on at any point. We can't always restore everyone this way. That's why we're also sending staff to the area to check our equipment.\n\nEvery fault is different, so our time frames have to be estimated but currently we hope to have power back on between 12:30 and 13:30. We must stress that it may become necessary for this to change, depending on what our engineers find.\n\nWe'll keep you updated with our progress.",

The power was switched off to enable our contractors to complete maintenance works on a piece of equipment called a transformer near New Road. Our contractors have advised us that the 43 affected properties will be restored early between approximately 10:20 and 10:45. This is due to good accessibility on site meaning that the works have progressed well and can be completed ahead of schedule. Once these works are complete this will improve the reliability of the electricity network. Our reference number for this work is INCD-97063-V. I hope that the power coming on earlier is of benefit to you. We always aim to provide a 10/10 service, if you feel we have not delivered you a 10/10 service then please call us on 105.",

        "Comment": "Good morning, this is a message from Harry at UK Power Networks regarding the planned power cut which is currently in progress today the 27th November 2025 in the CT6 postcode area. The power was switched off to enable our contractors to complete maintenance works on a piece of equipment called a transformer near New Road. Our contractors have advised us that the 43 affected properties will be restored early between approximately 10:20 and 10:45. This is due to good accessibility on site meaning that the works have progressed well and can be completed ahead of schedule. Once these works are complete this will improve the reliability of the electricity network. Our reference number for this work is INCD-97063-V. I hope that the power coming on earlier is of benefit to you. We always aim to provide a 10/10 service, if you feel we have not delivered you a 10/10 service then please call us on 105.",
