This has identified cables and 11 poles that need replacing and upgrading. We will also be carrying out some tree trimming in various locations. Doing this will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut in the future. To complete the work safely, we need to turn your power off to upgrade the equipment. To ensure the power is off for the shortest possible time, our engineers may carry out preparation works prior to the power cut. This work is taking place on Griston Road and Mill Lane.

Our engineers have advised that there is going to be a delay in restoring your power this afternoon. This is because some damage has been caused to our overhead equipment by a third party. As this is in the same area as where the planned work is taking place, our engineers are going to complete the urgent repairs whilst the power is off.   We now estimate to restore your power between approximately 16:30-17:30. This is an estimated time frame so your power may come on sooner.  Our reference number for this work is INCD-327324-U. We would like to apologise for any inconvenience this may cause you. If you have any questions or you have moved from the ME17 postcode area, then please give us a call on 105",

This has identified 15 cables and 12 poles that need replacing and upgrading. Doing this will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut in the future as we appreciate your area has been impacted with unplanned power cuts in the last 6 months. To complete the work safely, we need to turn your power off to upgrade the equipment. To ensure the power is off for the shortest possible time, our contractors Avidety may carry out preparation works prior to the power cut. Avidety will need access to the inside of your property to conduct safety checks in the morning before we switch off the power and we will need to do another check when we turn the power back on.

Our engineers have advised that the planned power cut is being aborted. This is due to wet ground conditions making it too difficult for the works to be carried out. Our engineers have advised us that supplies will be restored at 12:30. The remaining works may be re-scheduled to a later date and affected customers will be notified nearer the time. Our reference number for this is INCD-24568-O. We would like to apologise for any inconvenience this may cause you. If you have any questions or you have moved from the HP16 postcode area, then please give us a call on 105",

We have now restored power to all but one property. We're sorry for any disruption this unexpected power cut caused.\n\nIf your power isn't back on, we'd still like to keep you updated. If we aren't currently in contact with you by phone or in person at your property, please call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage.

Thanks for bearing with us during the power cut, I know the lights being off is a worry.\n\nOur staff have advised that bad weather and issues with access has slowed them down. Due to the delay this has caused, they've advised a new time of 10:00-11:00 to have your power back on.\n\nI know another delay is frustrating; our engineers always try to give us the best estimate that they can but due to the safety elements of working with live electricity, sometimes they have to adjust their repairs at short notice.\n\nI'm sorry if this has caused you to change any plans you've made, but we'll be here to update you until the lights are safely back on.",

Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

They may also walk our cabling route throughout the area to check for any visible problems, check smaller electrical sites in the area, or apply specialist equipment which may restore power temporarily to help them with their testing.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nWe'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",

They may also walk our cabling route throughout the area to check for any visible problems, check smaller electrical sites in the area, or apply specialist equipment which may restore power temporarily to help them with their testing.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nWe'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",

They may also walk our cabling route throughout the area to check for any visible problems, check smaller electrical sites in the area, or apply specialist equipment which may restore power temporarily to help them with their testing.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nWe'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",

Using an average timescale for this type of issue, we're looking to have you back on between12:00 and 13:00, however we must stress that this time may change, depending on what our staff find.\n\nWe know that a power cut can be very disruptive; we understand this can greatly impact your daily activities and we want to support you however we can. We'll update you with all of our progress, but for more information about this type of fault; here's a short YouTube video https://UKPN.short.gy/fuse. Sent by Adam at 09:03.",

        "Comment": "Hello, Aaron from the messaging team here. Thanks for your patience today, our field staff and control room engineers are working to get your power back on as quickly as they can.\n\nOur records show that some properties affected by today's power cut may have had other unexpected interruptions recently. If you have, we're sorry for further disruption. All power cuts are fully investigated by our engineers but can sometimes happen multiple times before we can safely find the issue and fix it.\n\nWe know that not everyone affected by today's power cut will have had other power cuts recently, but we want you to know that if you have, our customer services team will try to update as many customers as possible about our investigations.",

In addition to this, they are liaising closely with our control room to find safe and reliable ways to divert power around any problems and get everyone restored.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them. We'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",

If this is the case at your property, don't worry; I'll still keep you informed.\n\nIf your electricity has come back on now, or does so at any time in the future, simply click this link to stop receiving our SMS updates: https://UKPN.short.gy/STOP.",

We believe the issue is an underground network fault that initially interrupted power to 4845  properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 553 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 16:30-17:30, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

We have already sent staff to the area, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting the electricity around the faulty section. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will locate and repair the issue, which will take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",
