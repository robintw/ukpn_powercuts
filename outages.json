To give them time to do this safely, the estimated time frame to restore your power is now between 01:00 and 02:00.\n\nWe're sorry this is taking longer than expected, and we'll continue to keep you up to date, but if any change to this time comes in from our staff I'll let you know as soon as we hear.",

By doing this, we've managed to restore power to 3110 customers. There are now 84 properties still affected and using an average time frame we're estimating all power will be on between 21:30 and 22:30, but this may change later depending on what our staff find.\n\nWe'll keep sending SMS updates until everybody is restored.

        "Comment": "Sent by Simon at 22:09 - Our engineers are on their way. We believe the issue is an overhead network fault that initially interrupted power to 509 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 264 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 00:00-01:00, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

We're arranging staff to attend ASAP, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting electricity. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to get as many customers back on as we can.\n\nOnce available, our engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, they will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will work to locate the issue and make repairs, which may take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing but we'll always give you the clearest information we have.",

The issue was caused by an unexpected fault with some of our network equipment, which our engineers have now replaced.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

As such, they have replaced our substation equipment to restore power as quickly as possible.\n\nI'm sorry this affected your power again today.

We didn't know this was going to happen, so time frames we provide throughout are estimated and are subject to change.\n\nOur estimated time to have power back on is currently between 01:30 and 02:30, but after we arrive and assess the situation this may change. The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",

At this point we think the issue is an overhead network fault affecting 96 properties.\n\nSpecialist engineers from our control room are also working to divert power remotely, so it's possible your power could come back on at any point. We can't always restore everyone this way. That's why we're also sending staff to the area to check our equipment.\n\nEvery fault is different, so our time frames have to be estimated but currently we hope to have power back on between 11:00 and 12:00. We must stress that it may become necessary for this to change, depending on what our engineers find.\n\nWe'll keep you updated with our progress.",

We believe the issue is an overhead network fault that initially interrupted power to 2501 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 583 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 12:30-13:30, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

We have already sent staff to the area, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting the electricity around the faulty section. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will locate and repair the issue, which will take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",

At this point we think the issue is on our underground network affecting 365 properties.\n\nSpecialist engineers from our control room are also working to divert power remotely, so it's possible your power could come back on at any point. We can't always restore everyone this way. That's why we're also sending staff to the area to check our equipment.\n\nEvery fault is different, so our time frames have to be estimated but currently we hope to have power back on between 13:00 and 14:00. We must stress that it may become necessary for this to change, depending on what our engineers find.\n\nWe'll keep you updated with our progress.",

We know your power may have been off for a long time, we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.\n",

I wanted to let you know that our ground teams have managed to restore some further power, but as they've been hard at work restoring power, we've only just been informed.\n\nThey managed to divert power to a further 89 customers, leaving 69 properties still without electricity. I'm sorry for the delay letting you know, but if your lights are back on you can stop our SMS updates any time; just visit our website here - https://bit.ly/348KOZ3.\n\nI know it must be frustrating if your power is still off, but our staff are making progress and I'll let you know more news as soon as we have it.",

Our staff are working as quickly as they can to get the lights back on, and they've advised us that there are now 211 properties still affected.\n\nThey have managed to get a further 256 of our customers back on by diverting electricity, so your power may have come on sooner than we originally advised.\n\nIf you're still off, please don't worry; work on the issue will continue along with SMS updates until everyone is back on.\n\nTo stop receiving texts, just follow this link https://bit.ly/348KOZ3 to unsubscribe.",

Today's power cut was an unexpected overhead network fault that affected 2203 properties, so I'm sorry that we weren't able to provide you with prior notice. I'm pleased to report our staff have resolved this by diverting power to get your lights back on as soon as possible.\n\nWe contact customers when we are made aware of problems like this, so if you would like to be notified in future let us know here https://bit.ly/3zyHC6L\n\nI personally apologise for the disruption this caused you.

Our staff are working as quickly as they can to get the lights back on, and they've advised us that there are now 169 properties still affected.\n\nThey have managed to get a further 347 of our customers back on by diverting electricity, so your power may have come on sooner than we originally advised.\n\nIf you're still off, please don't worry; work on the issue will continue along with SMS updates until everyone is back on.\n\nTo stop receiving texts, just follow this link https://bit.ly/348KOZ3 to unsubscribe.",
