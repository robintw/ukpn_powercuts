We believe there may be a fault on our underground electricity cabling in the area, but currently it has not developed to a stage that our staff can pinpoint it. Their tests have proven inconclusive, so for now they have replaced our safety equipment in the underground connection box to get your power back on as quickly as possible.\n\nThis may happen again before we're able to fix it, but if you'd like to talk to us about this, or if your power isn't on call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

They may also walk our cabling route throughout the area to check for any visible problems, check smaller electrical sites in the area, or apply specialist equipment which may restore power temporarily to help them with their testing.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice.

        "Comment": "Sent by Bev at 15:42 - I'm pleased to confirm that all power in the Fishermans Drive area should be back on. The issue was caused by an unexpected fault on our underground cabling network, which our engineers have now repaired.\n\nWe know that a power cut can be difficult, and I'm sorry for the length of the time you were without your electricity. Please rest assured that our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

However, it was only necessary to interrupt power to some of these properties for a short while, so you might find your power only went off briefly.\n\nIf this is the case and your power is back on now, you can unsubscribe from the SMS service through our website, here - https://bit.ly/348KOZ3\n\nWe also know your power may still be affected, and if so we apologise but we'll keep you updated with all of our progress. For more information about why we sometimes have to switch power off to work; here's a short video https://bit.ly/3cYez0V.",

If you have, we're sorry for further disruption. All power cuts are fully investigated by our engineers but can sometimes happen multiple times before we can safely find the issue and fix it.\n\nWe know that not everyone affected by today's power cut will have had other power cuts recently, but we want you to know that if you have, our customer services team will try to update as many customers as possible about our investigations.",

We have already sent staff to the area, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting the electricity around the faulty section. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will locate and repair the issue, which will take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",
