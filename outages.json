We didn't know this was going to happen, so time frames we provide throughout are estimated and are subject to change.\n\nOur estimated time to have power back on is currently between 17:00 and 18:00, but after we arrive and assess the situation this may change. The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",

Due to there being multiple power cuts over a short space of time, our engineers are going to be testing if the network is still healthy.\n\nThey will start at the substation, and often apply specialist equipment that may turn your power back on for a brief period, so don't worry if your power comes on and goes off again. They will also check smaller sites which run along our cabling route, these break our network down into smaller sections and can help pinpoint any possible problems.\n\nOur estimated time frame of 2000 - 2100 hasn't changed, so I'll let you know more once our staff update us.

Our engineers have turned off the power in the Harleston IP20 area in the interest of the public's health and safety.

However, based on an average for this kind of issue, our estimated time to have you back on is between 20:00 and 21:00. \n\nWe'll keep you updated with our progress, but in the meantime our team are always here to talk on 105 if you have any questions or concerns.",

        "Comment": "Sent by Aaron at 17:29 - We're very sorry we've had to switch off your electricity. Our engineers have turned off the power in the Harleston IP20 area in the interest of the public's health and safety. This is so they can investigate reports of a low overhead line.\n\nIf in the area, please take care and stay at least 10m away from the cable. \n\nUntil our engineers arrive on site and investigate, it's difficult to advise you a time frame. However, based on an average for this kind of issue, our estimated time to have you back on is between 20:00 and 21:00. \n\nWe'll keep you updated with our progress, but in the meantime our team are always here to talk on 105 if you have any questions or concerns.",

        "Comment": "What will happen next?\n\nWe have been alerted to a potentially dangerous situation involving a low overhead cable, so have responded as quickly as possible and asked our control room to turn power off to the area using our high voltage network. This is why a wide area has lost electricity.\n\nOnce further specialist field staff have assessed the situation, we'll start diverting power back to affected homes as soon as they advise us it's safe. You may notice your lights going on and off as we work to get as much power restored as we can.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",
