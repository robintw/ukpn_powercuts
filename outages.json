These trees could cause damage to the cables and affect your electricity supply. During this time we will also be replacing a faulty piece of equipment called a transformer which was the reason some customers may have experienced and unplanned outage back in August.Our engineers need to temporarily switch off your power so a tree surgeon can safely cut the trees away from the cables. Doing this will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut in the future as we appreciate that some customers may have experienced both planned and unplanned power cuts in the last 6 months.

We have now restored power to all but one property. We're sorry for any disruption this unexpected power cut caused.\n\nIf your power isn't back on, we'd still like to keep you updated. If we aren't currently in contact with you by phone or in person at your property, please call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage and how long you were off for. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",

Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point.

Every outage is fully investigated by our engineers, though power may be lost several times before we can safely find and fix the issue. Our customer services team will keep as many customers updated as possible during these investigations. \n\nWe're sorry for the unplanned disruption.

We believe the issue is an underground network fault that initially interrupted power to 1571 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 327 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 12:00-13:00, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

We have already sent staff to the area, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting the electricity around the faulty section. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will locate and repair the issue, which will take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",

We didn't know this was going to happen, so time frames we provide throughout are estimated and are subject to change.\n\nOur estimated time to have power back on is currently between 14:30 and 15:30, but after we arrive and assess the situation this may change. The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",

They are going to test our equipment thoroughly to check if the underlying issue can be located before they attempt to restore your power again.\n\nI know having power cuts this often must be causing you a lot of problems, and our staff are doing everything they can to keep the power on. Apologies, I provided the wrong estimated time frame in my previous text. The estimated time frame is between 21:00-22:00, although as we mentioned previously this can be subject to change.\n\nWe're keeping in touch with our staff regularly to make sure you have the best information to plan ahead. I'll update you as soon as we hear more from them.",
