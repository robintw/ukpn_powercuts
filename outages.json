        "Comment": "Good afternoon, this is a message from Ryan at UK Power Networks regarding the planned power cut that is scheduled for today the 21st of January 2026 in the CB7 postcode area. Our contractors have advised us that unfortunately there is going to be a delay in the power being switched off. This is due to an earlier job being delayed because of traffic congestion which has had a knock-on effect to these works. We now estimate to switch off your power at approximately 13:30. Our reference number for this work is INCD-17293-I. We would like to apologise for any inconvenience this may cause you. If you have any questions or you have moved from the CB7 postcode area, then please call 105.",

        "Comment": "Our staff have now arrived on site in the Hornsey Road area. They will start running tests at our substation to see how the local network is operating.\n\nIt's quite common for power to be restored briefly and go off again; this is our engineers using testing equipment to energise different sections of our network - this helps to narrow down any possible issues.\n\nOur cabling network is often broken down by smaller sites, and our staff may also check these to test for any problems, and they may also walk the cabling route to see if there are any signs of malfunction that have appeared on the surface. Our time frame hasn't been adjusted, so for now I'll let you know more news as soon as our staff update us.\n\nSent by Theo at 08:12.",

Our engineers have advised that the temporary generators are now en route to the LU7 0 area. Once they are on site they will work to connect them to the electrical network and restore your power. At the moment we don't need to change the estimated timeframe. \n\nWe're sorry for the disruption this power cut may be causing. If you're worried about elderly or ill neighbours, we can offer help and support to our vulnerable customers during a power cut. Find out more here: https://bit.ly/40quttu.\n\nIf you have any concerns, please call us on 08003163105",

All power cuts are fully investigated by our engineers but can sometimes happen multiple times before we can safely find the issue and fix it.\n\nWe know that not everyone affected by today's power cut will have had other power cuts recently, but we want you to know that if you have, our customer services team will try to update as many customers as possible about our investigations.",

        "Comment": "Winter is here and temperatures are low, so we understand that it can be very concerning to have a power cut as this may have affected your heating.\n\nShould you have a gas hob, you may be able to carefully ignite it with matches or a lighter in order for you to warm up with a hot drink or meal. Please only attempt this if you are confident it can be done safely.\n\nIf you have someone in the property who may be more vulnerable to the cold please do not hesitate to call us free on 105.\n\nWe will do our best to provide additional care and support whilst work continues to get your power back on ASAP.",

They will start running tests at our substation to see how the local network is operating.\n\nIt's quite common for power to be restored briefly and go off again; this is our engineers using testing equipment to energise different sections of our network - this helps to narrow down any possible issues.\n\nOur cabling network is often broken down by smaller sites, and our staff may also check these to test for any problems, and they may also walk the cabling route to see if there are any signs of malfunction that have appeared on the surface. Our time frame hasn't been adjusted, so for now I'll let you know more news as soon as our staff update us.\n\nSent by David at 17:31.",

        "Comment": "Sent by David at 16:59 - Our staff are on the way to the Norwich Road area, and our estimated time frame to have power back on is currently between 20:00 and 21:00. However, this could change once our staff have assessed the local network.\n\nWe believe the power cuts you have been experiencing are caused by a fault with one of the cables. Developing faults can start very small, and so can be hard to detect but each power cut usually makes it easier to see, which means our specialist staff can detect it, and work on the repair to prevent further outages.\n\nI'll let you know once our teams arrive.",
