As such, they have replaced our substation equipment to restore power as quickly as possible.\n\nI'm sorry this affected your power again today. This may happen again before we're able to pinpoint the issue and fix it, but if you'd like to talk to us about anything or if your power isn't on, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

They are going to test our equipment thoroughly to check if the underlying issue can be located before they attempt to restore your power again.\n\nI know having power cuts this often must be causing you a lot of problems, and our staff are doing everything they can to keep the power on. Our estimated time frame is currently between 00:30-01:30, although as we mentioned previously this can be subject to change.\n\nWe're keeping in touch with our staff regularly to make sure you have the best information to plan ahead.

This means we have been able to restore power sooner than we anticipated, we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.\n\n",

We believe the issue is an underground network fault that initially interrupted power to 1564 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 438 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 01:30-02:30, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

They will then check our network equipment throughout the area to try and identify any problems, before trying to restore power.\n\nOur estimated time frame of 15:00-16:00 hasn't changed, but if this is not successful it's possible that a cable repair may be needed. This can involve ground excavations, traffic management equipment or specialist teams. As soon as our staff can safely update us, we'll give you the latest news. Sent by David at 11:44.",

We are sending our engineers back to the Studley Road area to investigate why.\n\nCurrently, our time frame for power to be restored is between 15:00 and 16:00, but once our staff arrive on site and assess the situation, this time may change. As there have been other power cuts recently it's difficult to know what repairs will be needed to restore your power safely, so time frames we provide throughout have to be estimated.\n\nThe results of our engineer's tests on our network will let us know if our estimate needs to be adjusted, so we'll update you as soon as they have arrived on site and investigated.",
