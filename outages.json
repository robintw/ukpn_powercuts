        "Comment": "Our engineers have now arrived on site in the TN22 3 / RH17 7 area to investigate the cause of the voltage issues.\n\nOur estimated time frame of 19:30 and 20:30 hasn't changed, but our staff will be checking our network equipment and cabling throughout the area to identify any problems. Depending on what they find, it's possible our time frame may need to change later.\n\nWe know that a power cut can be very disruptive; we understand this can greatly impact your daily activities and we want to support you however we can. If you have any concerns, our team are always here on 08003163105. Sent by Roland at 17:52.",

Every outage is fully investigated by our engineers, though power may be lost several times before we can safely find and fix the issue. Our customer services team will keep as many customers updated as possible during these investigations. \n\nWe're sorry for the unplanned disruption.

Our engineers have just called in to advise us the have run into complications with the repairs and re erecting of the overhead cables that are laying on the ground, this is due to thick shrubbery that is hindering our progress to restore your power.\n\nUnfortunately, it's going to take us past our current time frame to complete this safely, so we're now working towards between 20:30 and 21:30 to have power back on.\n\nWe can appreciate how frustrating and disruptive being without power can be, and our staff are working as fast as they can. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to speak to our team, but I'll let you know further news as it comes in from site. Sent by David at 18:31.",

Our engineers investigated the fault earlier but it seems there may be a bigger underlying issue which is causing our substation equipment to operate repeatedly.\n\nOur engineers will be back on site as quickly as possible and using an average time frame, we are aiming to have all power back on between 21:00 and 22:00. We'll keep you updated with all of our progress.",

We know a power cut can be difficult, especially in colder weather.\n\nMany properties have gas hobs, which can still be used in a power cut for cooking, or heating water for drinks and sterilisation of baby bottles. The spark to ignite the hob will not work however, so if you do use it please take extra care when using other ignition sources like matches or lighters.

We know a power cut can be difficult, especially in colder weather.\n\nMany properties have gas hobs, which can still be used in a power cut for cooking, or heating water for drinks and sterilisation of baby bottles. The spark to ignite the hob will not work however, so if you do use it please take extra care when using other ignition sources like matches or lighters. Even in daytime, the light in your house may be low in a power cut, so only do this if you are confident it can be done safely.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns, our team are always on hand to help.",

They will start running tests at our substation to see how the local network is operating.\n\nIt's quite common for power to be restored briefly and go off again; this is our engineers using testing equipment to energise different sections of our network - this helps to narrow down any possible issues.\n\nOur cabling network is often broken down by smaller sites, and our staff may also check these to test for any problems, and they may also walk the cabling route to see if there are any signs of malfunction that have appeared on the surface. Our time frame hasn't been adjusted, so for now I'll let you know more news as soon as our staff update us.\n\nSent by Theo at 20:53.",

However, this could change once our staff have assessed the local network.\n\nWe believe the power cuts you have been experiencing are caused by a fault with one of the cables. Developing faults can start very small, and so can be hard to detect but each power cut usually makes it easier to see, which means our specialist staff can detect it, and work on the repair to prevent further outages.\n\nI'll let you know once our teams arrive.",

They're in the process of removing it and out estimated time frame of 23:30-00:30 has not changed. \n\nI know that power being off may be especially worrying for you as we head later into the evening, but our field teams work 24 hours so I'll let know further news as soon as it comes in.

In addition to this, they are liaising closely with our control room to find safe and reliable ways to divert power around any problems and get everyone restored.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice.

        "Comment": "Hi, Simon from the messaging team here; just a quick recap on what's happened during the power cut so far. Our engineers are still on site in the SG19 2 area. We are currently waiting for the Water Board to complete the repairs to a water leak in the area. Once they have been able to finish the repairs, we can then assess our cables and work to restore power as quickly and safely as possible. \n\nAt the moment, we are not able to provide an estimated restoration time until the repairs to the water leak have been completed. \n\nI'm sorry for the continued disruption, but I'll keep you informed with news from site. If you have any concerns, please call us on 08003163105.",

They may also walk our cabling route throughout the area to check for any visible problems, check smaller electrical sites in the area, or apply specialist equipment which may restore power temporarily to help them with their testing.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nWe'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",

I'm afraid this may happen again, but every time you lose power it gives us a better chance of pinpointing the problem.\n\nI'm sorry for the continued disruption, but if you'd like to talk to us or if your power isn't on, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

However, this could change once our staff have assessed the local network.\n\nWe believe the power cuts you have been experiencing are caused by a fault with one of the cables. Developing faults can start very small, and so can be hard to detect but each power cut usually makes it easier to see, which means our specialist staff can detect it, and work on the repair to prevent further outages.\n\nI'll let you know once our teams arrive.",
