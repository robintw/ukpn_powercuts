Our estimated time to have your power back on is between 15:30 and 16:30, however, this may need to change later depending on how our works progress.\n\nIf you'd like more information about why we sometimes have to switch power off to work; here's a short video https://bit.ly/3cYez0V.

We believe there may be an underlying issue causing this, but it is proving difficult for our engineers to locate and therefore fix. To get your power back on today we have reconfigured the local electricity network. This in turn will both help pinpoint the issue and minimise further interruptions.\n\nIf you'd like more information on the issue, or if your power isn't back on, call us on 08003163105. We know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",

I'm sorry for the power cut today; I know the lights going off can be disruptive.\n\nWe know that some customers affected by todays power cut may have had other issues recently, and I appreciate this is frustrating. High voltage cabling can cover a wide area, so sometimes properties very close to you may have had power cuts that you didn't experience.\n\nI know you may not have had any previous power cuts, but if you have, we often get progress updates from our field staff management about investigations into repeat issues, and our Customer Services team will try to contact everyone affected by them to explain what's happening.",

Our engineers are on site in the St. Marys Garth area, currently affecting 39 properties. We believe a fault on the overhead network has caused the power to go off. This was an unplanned issue, so we didn't know this was going to happen. \n\nWe are still aiming to have the power back on between 17:00 and 18:00. \n\nI'm sorry for the continued disruption, but I'll keep you informed with news from site.

        "Comment": "Sent by Kevin at 17:36 - Our staff are on the way to the Levetts Lane area, and our estimated time frame to have power back on is currently between 21:00 and 22:00. However, this could change once our staff have assessed the local network.\n\nWe believe the power cuts you have been experiencing are caused by a fault with one of the cables. Developing faults can start very small, and so can be hard to detect but each power cut usually makes it easier to see, which means our specialist staff can detect it, and work on the repair to prevent further outages.\n\nI'll let you know once our teams arrive.",

For now we have restored your power as quickly as we can.\n\nIf your power isn't on or you would like to talk to us, call us for free on 08003163105.

They will start running tests at our substation to see how the local network is operating.\n\nIt's quite common for power to be restored briefly and go off again; this is our engineers using testing equipment to energise different sections of our network - this helps to narrow down any possible issues.\n\nOur cabling network is often broken down by smaller sites, and our staff may also check these to test for any problems, and they may also walk the cabling route to see if there are any signs of malfunction that have appeared on the surface. Our time frame hasn't been adjusted, so for now I'll let you know more news as soon as our staff update us.\n\nSent by Aaron at 20:14.",

However, this could change once our staff have assessed the local network.\n\nWe believe the power cuts you have been experiencing are caused by a fault with one of the cables. Developing faults can start very small, and so can be hard to detect but each power cut usually makes it easier to see, which means our specialist staff can detect it, and work on the repair to prevent further outages.\n\nI'll let you know once our teams arrive.",
