Thames Water have arrived and are assessing what repairs they need to do to stop the water leak. Due to this it is now hindering our progress to carry on with repairs and we have had to remove the estimated timeframe until we know further from Thames water\n\nWe're sorry for the disruption this power cut will be causing, especially the impact it will be having on the start to your day.

        "Comment": "Sent by Kevin at 19:49 - We can now confirm that all power in the NR12 0 / NR28 9 area should be back on. Our engineers have diverted as much power as they can. However, due to the location and complexity of the issue, we have also used  temporary generators to restore power to the last of the affected properties. This will provide power until our engineers plan in and safely complete the full repair, which may take a few days.\n\nWe're really sorry for any disruption this unexpected power cut caused. If your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\n",

As such, they have replaced our substation equipment to restore power as quickly as possible.\n\nI'm sorry this affected your power again today. This may happen again before we're able to pinpoint the issue and fix it, but if you'd like to talk to us about anything or if your power isn't on, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

We didn't know this was going to happen, so time frames we provide throughout are estimated and are subject to change.\n\nOur estimated time to have power back on is currently between 22:00 and 23:00, but after we arrive and assess the situation this may change. The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",

Our team of cable jointers have identified the suspected section of faulted underground cabling using their specialist equipment.\n\nOur digging team will excavate the underground network fault so that we can carry out repairs and restore power. This can take some time depending on the surface material, and how much space is needed to allow our engineers to assess the fault and make their repairs safely. \n\nOur estimated time frame of 04:30 and 05:30 doesn't need to change currently. We'll continue to keep you updated, but our team are always here if you have any questions.",

        "Comment": "Our engineers have now arrived on site in the High Street area.\n\nAs any issues that currently exist on our network have affected our equipment at the substation, engineers will start their testing there. They will then check our network equipment throughout the area to try and identify any problems, before trying to restore power.\n\nOur estimated time frame of 23:30-00:30 hasn't changed, but if this is not successful it's possible that a cable repair may be needed. This can involve ground excavations, traffic management equipment or specialist teams. As soon as our staff can safely update us, we'll give you the latest news. Sent by Stuart at 20:16.\n",

Please only attempt this if you are confident it can be done safely.\n\nIf you have someone in the property who may be more vulnerable to the cold please do not hesitate to call us free on 105.\n\nWe will do our best to provide additional care and support whilst work continues to get your power back on ASAP.",

We believe the issue is an underground network fault that initially interrupted power to 1550 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 9 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 04:30 and 05:30, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?
