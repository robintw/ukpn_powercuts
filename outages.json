We didn't know this was going to happen, so time frames we provide throughout are estimated and are subject to change.\n\nOur estimated time to have power back on is currently between 22:30 and 23:30, but after we arrive and assess the situation this may change. The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",

I know having power cuts as often as this must be very disruptive, and our staff are doing everything they can to get this resolved.\n\nThey are still testing our network in the area, and have been able to restore power to some properties. Depending on the local infrastructure the testing can take some time. However, once they update us we'll know if our estimated time frame needs to change and why, and I'll let you know as soon as we hear.\n\nIn the meantime, if we can offer any support or advice, our team are always available to talk on 105.\n\nSent by Bev at 02:20.",
