Our engineers have advised us that the 10 affected properties will be restored early between approximately 13:15-13:30 as the works have progressed better than expected. We can confirm that once power has been restored to the area that the works for a third party to trim trees around 1 section of overhead cables near The Ridge will be completed which will adhere to the customer request and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut in the future. Our reference number for this work is INCD-105820-C. I hope that the power coming on earlier is of benefit to you.

        "Comment": "Good afternoon, this is a message from Ryan at UK Power Networks regarding the planned power cut which is currently in progress today the 18th of December 2025 in the CM3 postcode area. Our engineers have advised us that the 10 affected properties will be restored early between approximately 13:15-13:30 as the works have progressed better than expected. We can confirm that once power has been restored to the area that the works for a third party to trim trees around 1 section of overhead cables near The Ridge will be completed which will adhere to the customer request and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut in the future. Our reference number for this work is INCD-105820-C. I hope that the power coming on earlier is of benefit to you. We always aim to provide a 10/10 service, if you feel we have not delivered you a 10/10 service then please call us on 105.",

        "Comment": "Good morning, this is a message from Alicia at UK Power Networks regarding the planned power cut which is currently in progress today the 18th December 2025 in the CB23 postcode area. The power was switched off to enable our engineers to run some essential checks on a piece of equipment called a transformer near Barton Road.  Our engineers have advised us that works have gone well and affected properties will be restored slightly earlier than planned at approximately 11:30. Once power has been restored to the area, this has improved the reliability of the electricity network, ensured the equipment is running to the best of its ability and reduced the risk of you having an unplanned power cut. Our reference number for this work is INCD-105884-C. I hope that the power coming on earlier is of benefit to you. We always aim to provide a 10/10 service, if you feel we have not delivered you a 10/10 service then please call us on 105. Thank you",

Please only attempt this if you are confident it can be done safely.\n\nIf you have someone in the property who may be more vulnerable to the cold please do not hesitate to call us free on 105.\n\nWe will do our best to provide additional care and support whilst work continues to get your power back on ASAP.",

In addition to this, they are liaising closely with our control room to find safe and reliable ways to divert power around any problems and get everyone restored.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them. We'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",

        "Comment": "Our engineers are on site in the Woodbridge IP12 2 area and are investigating the fault.\n\nYou may find your power is going on and off; that is normal for this type of issue and is due to our engineers working to divert power remotely. By doing this, we've managed to restore power to 563 customers. There are now 30 properties still affected and using an average time frame we're estimating all power will be on between 19:00 and 20:00, but this may change later depending on what our staff find.\n\nWe'll keep sending SMS updates until everybody is restored.

In addition to this, they are liaising closely with our control room to find safe and reliable ways to divert power around any problems and get everyone restored.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them. We'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",

We have already sent staff to the area, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting the electricity around the faulty section. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will locate and repair the issue, which will take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",

We can't always restore everyone this way. That's why we're also sending staff to the area to check our equipment.\n\nEvery fault is different, so our time frames have to be estimated but currently we hope to have power back on between 17:30-18:30.

We have already sent staff to the area, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting the electricity around the faulty section. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will locate and repair the issue, which will take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",

We have already sent staff to the area, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting the electricity around the faulty section. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will locate and repair the issue, which will take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",

Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 19:00 and 20:00, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?
