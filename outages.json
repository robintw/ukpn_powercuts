We have already sent staff to the area, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting the electricity around the faulty section. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will locate and repair the issue, which will take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",

At this point we think the issue is an overhead network fault affecting 86 properties.\n\nSpecialist engineers from our control room are also working to divert power remotely, so it's possible your power could come back on at any point. We can't always restore everyone this way. That's why we're also sending staff to the area to check our equipment.\n\nEvery fault is different, so our time frames have to be estimated but currently we hope to have power back on between 14:30 and 15:30. We must stress that it may become necessary for this to change, depending on what our engineers find.\n\nWe'll keep you updated with our progress.",
