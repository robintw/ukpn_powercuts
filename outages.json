Doing this will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut in the future as we appreciate your area has been impacted with unplanned power cuts in the last 6 months. This work is taking place in the Freezen Hill, Blue Pump Farm and Hill Farm area.",

There are now only 5 properties without power, who we'll speak to directly. If you're without power and haven't been contacted, then we'll need to hear from you. Please call us on 08003163105 (free from landlines and mobiles).\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the unexpected outage.

We have already sent staff to the area, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting the electricity around the faulty section. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will locate and repair the issue, which will take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",

We believe the issue is on our underground that initially interrupted power to 1883 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 1539 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 12:30 and 13:30, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

This means we have been able to restore power sooner than we anticipated , we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.",

We believe the issue is underground fault that initially interrupted power to 1384 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 786 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between *13:00 and 14:00, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

They will then check our network equipment throughout the area to try and identify any problems, before trying to restore power.\n\nOur estimated time frame of between 14:00 and 15:00 hasn't changed, but if this is not successful it's possible that a cable repair may be needed. This can involve ground excavations, traffic management equipment or specialist teams. As soon as our staff can safely update us, we'll give you the latest news. Sent by Kevin at 11:30.",

We are sending our engineers back to the Theobald Street area to investigate why.\n\nCurrently, our time frame for power to be restored is between 14:00 and 15:00, but once our staff arrive on site and assess the situation, this time may change. As there have been other power cuts recently it's difficult to know what repairs will be needed to restore your power safely, so time frames we provide throughout have to be estimated.\n\nThe results of our engineer's tests on our network will let us know if our estimate needs to be adjusted, so we'll update you as soon as they have arrived on site and investigated.",

We believe our engineers have been able to restore power to all 1480 customers in the IP13 8 and IP13 9 area, by repairing and re erecting the overhead electrical cables that were laying on the ground. We know your power may have been off for a long time, we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on.

Our engineers have just called in to advise us they have run into complications with the ongoing work to repair and re-erect the overhead cables that are laying on the ground in the IP13 area\n\nUnfortunately, it's going to take us past our current time frame to complete this safely, so we're now working towards between 02:00-03:00 to have power back on.\n\nWe can appreciate how frustrating and disruptive being without power can be, and our staff are working as fast as they can. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to speak to our team, but I'll let you know further news as it comes in from site. Sent by David at 00:59.",

Our engineers have now repaired and re erected the overhead electrical cable that was laying on the ground, and have deemed it safe to restore power back to all 1657 properties in the IP13 8 and IP13 9 area.\n\nWe're very sorry we had to turn your power off unexpectedly, and with so little warning. We usually provide much more notice if we can, but in a situation like this our first priority is the safety of the public and our staff.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage.

Our engineers have now repaired and re erected the overhead electrical cable that was laying on the ground, and have deemed it safe to restore power back to all 1657 properties in the IP13 8 and IP13 9 area.\n\nWe're very sorry we had to turn your power off unexpectedly, and with so little warning. We usually provide much more notice if we can, but in a situation like this our first priority is the safety of the public and our staff.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. If your power is still off or if you have any questions, call our team on 08003163105.",

Our engineers have just called in to advise us they have run into complications with the ongoing work to repair and re-erect the overhead cables that are laying on the ground in the IP13 area\n\nUnfortunately, it's going to take us past our current time frame to complete this safely, so we're now working towards between 02:00-03:00 to have power back on.\n\nWe can appreciate how frustrating and disruptive being without power can be, and our staff are working as fast as they can. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to speak to our team, but I'll let you know further news as it comes in from site. Sent by David at 00:59.",

We believe our engineers have been able to restore power to all 81 customers in the NR34 7 area, by diverting power around a faulted piece of underground network equipment. This means we have been able to restore power sooner than we anticipated, we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.",
