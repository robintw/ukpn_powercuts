We want to be as transparent as possible as we know having multiple power cuts is disruptive and worrying, so I would like to help explain why we can't always fix a problem like this right away.\n\nUnderground electricity cabling is insulated for safety and if a fault develops, these materials can re-seal due to heat passing through them when our safety equipment operates and your power is lost. This covers any potential fault again, meaning our staff cannot locate it using their tests or specialist equipment.\n\nWe'll know more once our staff contact us again, so I'll be in touch again shortly.\n\nSent by Lee at 13:22.",

        "Comment": "Hi, Simon from the messaging team here; just a quick recap on what's happened during the power cut so far. Our engineers are still on site in the Alverston Gardens area. We have managed to get power restored to some properties, there are a number of properties still affected by the underground network fault.\n\nWe are still aiming to have the power back on between 14:00-15:00. If your power is back on now, please follow this link https://bit.ly/348KOZ3 to stop SMS updates.\n\nI'm sorry for the continued disruption, but I'll keep you informed with news from site. If you have any concerns, please call us on 08003163105.",

Although there were power cuts some months ago, now that our engineers have rectified this, we're pleased to say we do not believe it will cause any subsequent issues with your power.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the recent outages. If your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

Due to there being multiple power cuts over a short space of time, our engineers are going to start their tests at the nearby substation.\n\nOur current time frame is between 11:30 and 12:30; this is an estimate based on them checking the state of our network, and attempting to restore your power.\n\nIt's possible that the underground cabling fault we believe has been causing these power cuts has reach a point where they can't safely replace our substation equipment. If this happens we'll need to arrange further teams and equipment, so I'll let you know more news as soon as our staff update us. Sent by Adam at 08:26.",

We believe the issue is an overhead network fault that initially interrupted power to 2658 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 236 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 10:30-11:30, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

At this point we think the issue is on our overhead network affecting 29 properties.\n\nSpecialist engineers from our control room are also working to divert power remotely, so it's possible your power could come back on at any point. We can't always restore everyone this way. That's why we're also sending staff to the area to check our equipment.\n\nEvery fault is different, so our time frames have to be estimated but currently we hope to have power back on between 11:30 and 12:30. We must stress that it may become necessary for this to change, depending on what our engineers find.\n\nWe'll keep you updated with our progress.",

We didn't know this was going to happen, so time frames we provide throughout are estimated and are subject to change.\n\nOur estimated time to have power back on is currently between 18:30 and 19:30, but after we arrive and assess the situation this may change. The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",
