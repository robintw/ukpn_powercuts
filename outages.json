I'm very sorry you're still without power.\n\nOur engineers have been working hard to get you back on by replacing the 2 overhead poles and re-erecting cables that were on the ground due to a large tree falling onto them, but due to now needing access to the remaining 5 properties to check the electrical equipment before we can restore power fully. We now need to send out a relief team first thing this morning once we have access to the properties. This means that you may not receive any texts for a while.\n\nWe'll let you know as soon as our staff re-attend and we have some more information, but if you have any concerns in the meantime you can always reach our team here on 105.",

The issue was caused by an unexpected fault with some of our network equipment, which our engineers have now replaced.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

They may also walk our cabling route throughout the area to check for any visible problems, check smaller electrical sites in the area, or apply specialist equipment which may restore power temporarily to help them with their testing.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nWe'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",

Thank you for your patience while our engineers continue investigations on the underground network in the W14 0 and W6 7 area, we've now restored power to most of the affected properties. There are now only 4 properties without power, who we'll speak to directly. If you're without power and haven't been contacted, then we'll need to hear from you. Please call us on 08003163105 (free from landlines and mobiles).\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the unexpected outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",

In addition to this, they are liaising closely with our control room to find safe and reliable ways to divert power around any problems and get everyone restored.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them. We'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",

We believe our engineers have been able to restore power to all 2683 customers in the Broad Lane area, by repairing a faulted piece of overhead network equipment.

Our engineers have just called in to advise us they have run into complications with the ongoing work to repair the faulty overhead electrical equipment in the Broad Lane area which is now hindering our progress to restore your power.\n\nUnfortunately, it's going to take us past our current time frame to complete this safely, so we're now working towards between 01:00 and 02:00 to have power back on.\n\nWe can appreciate how frustrating and disruptive being without power can be, and our staff are working as fast as they can. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to speak to our team, but I'll let you know further news as it comes in from site. Sent by David at 00:00.",
