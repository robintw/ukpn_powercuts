At this point we think the issue is an overhead network fault affecting the Mill Street  area.\n\nUntil an engineer arrives on site, it's difficult to give a time of restoration. Using an average timescale for this type of power cut in your area, we're looking to have the power back on between 14:00 and 15:00. However, as the repair progresses; this may change.\n\nWe'll let you know once our staff arrive on site, and we'll keep you updated with all of our progress.",

I'm sorry for any disruption we caused by having to turn off your power to repair an unexpected overhead cable fault.\n\nWe'd still like to keep you informed if your electricity hasn't been restored. Please call us free any time on 08003163105 if we haven't already reached out to you by phone or in person at your property.\n\nWe apologise for the outage and understand that being without power can be challenging. Rest assured that our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep your lights on.",

For now we have restored your power as quickly as we can.\n\nIf your power isn't on or you would like to talk to us, call us for free on 08003163105. We know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",

        "Comment": "I appreciate your continued patience this evening. We want to be as transparent as possible as we know having multiple power cuts is disruptive and worrying, so I would like to help explain why we can't always fix a problem like this right away.\n\nUnderground electricity cabling is insulated for safety and if a fault develops, these materials can re-seal due to heat passing through them when our safety equipment operates and your power is lost. This covers any potential fault again, meaning our staff cannot locate it using their tests or specialist equipment.\n\nWe'll know more once our staff contact us again, so I'll be in touch again shortly.\n\nSent by Bev at 17:25.",

        "Comment": "Our staff have now arrived on site in the Ley Street area. Due to there being multiple power cuts over a short space of time, our engineers are going to be testing if the network is still healthy.\n\nThey will start at the substation, and often apply specialist equipment that may turn your power back on for a brief period, so don't worry if your power comes on and goes off again. They will also check smaller sites which run along our cabling route, these break our network down into smaller sections and can help pinpoint any possible problems.\n\nOur estimated time frame of 19:30-20:30 hasn't changed, so I'll let you know more once our staff update us.

They have diverted power around an overhead cable fault.\n\nWe know some properties in the area may have faced other recent interruptions, and we're sorry for the extra disruption. Every outage is fully investigated by our engineers, though power may be lost several times before we can safely find and fix the issue. Our customer services team will keep as many customers updated as possible during these investigations. \n\nWe're sorry for the unplanned disruption. If you need to talk to us, or let us know that your power isn't restored, call us on 08003163105.",

Our engineers have now investigated the grounded overhead cable, and have deemed it safe to restore power back to all 705 properties in the Aldeburgh road area.\n\nWe're very sorry we had to turn your power off unexpectedly, and with so little warning. We usually provide much more notice if we can, but in a situation like this our first priority is the safety of the public and our staff.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. If your power is still off or if you have any questions, call our team on 08003163105.",

For now we have restored your power as quickly as we can.\n\nIf your power isn't on or you would like to talk to us, call us for free on 08003163105. We know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",

However, this could change once our staff have assessed the local network.\n\nWe believe the power cuts you have been experiencing are caused by a fault with one of the cables. Developing faults can start very small, and so can be hard to detect but each power cut usually makes it easier to see, which means our specialist staff can detect it, and work on the repair to prevent further outages.\n\nI'll let you know once our teams arrive.",
