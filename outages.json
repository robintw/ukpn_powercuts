Excavations can sometimes take longer than expected, depending on ground conditions, other utility equipment like gas and water pipes, parked vehicles, or local traffic.\n\nAt the moment our estimated time frame of 12:00-13:00 hasn't changed, but as our staff are busy working with live electricity we need to wait until they can safely stop work and contact us with the latest information. Once they do, we'll update you further.\n\nOur team are always here if you have any questions.",

        "Comment": "Sent by Roland at 20:57 - Our staff are on the way to the Soulbury Road area, and our estimated time frame to have power back on is currently between 00:00 and 01:00. However, this could change once our staff have assessed the local network.\n\nWe believe the power cuts you have been experiencing are caused by a fault with one of the cables. Developing faults can start very small, and so can be hard to detect but each power cut usually makes it easier to see, which means our specialist staff can detect it, and work on the repair to prevent further outages.\n\nI'll let you know once our teams arrive.",

We need to examine a transformer on our electricity poles to check it is functioning properly. This essential work helps to provide a reliable electricity supply to your property, reducing the risk of any unplanned power cuts in the future. To keep everyone safe while we carry out these works, we will need to temporarily turn off your electricity. We are taking extra measures to limit the time your power is off and we'll do our best to cause as little disruption as possible. Doing this will improve the reliability of the electricity network in the future as we appreciate you may have been impacted by an unplanned power cut in the last 6 months.
