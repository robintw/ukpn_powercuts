If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to speak to our team, but I'll let you know further news as it comes in from site. Sent by Talie at 22:35.",

For now we have restored your power as quickly as we can.\n\nIf your power isn't on or you would like to talk to us, call us for free on 08003163105. We know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",
