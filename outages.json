        "Comment": "Sent by Decasta at 11:39 - Thanks for your patience today. Our engineers have let us know that they have isolated power following reports of a grounded overhead cable. They have investigated the grounded cable, and have deemed it safe to restore power back to all but 2 properties in the IP10 0 and IP11 0 area.\n\nWe're very sorry we had to turn your power off unexpectedly, and with so little warning. We usually provide much more notice if we can, but in a situation like this our first priority is the safety of the public and our staff.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. If your power is still off or if you have any questions, call our team on 08003163105.",

        "Comment": "What will happen next?\n\nThis outage affects multiple areas, so locations we mention may be further away than you expect. We're arranging staff to attend ASAP, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting electricity. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to get as many customers back on as we can.\n\nOnce available, our engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, they will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will work to locate the issue and make repairs, which may take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing but we'll always give you the clearest information we have.",

Our engineers had to unexpectedly turn off the power to 864 customers in the Cambridge, CB25 area to safely repair a low hanging overhead cable.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage ad the length of time you've been affected. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

I'm pleased to report our staff have resolved this by diverting power to get your lights back on as soon as possible.\n\nWe contact customers when we are made aware of problems like this, so if you would like to be notified in future let us know here https://bit.ly/3zyHC6L\n\nI personally apologise for the disruption this caused you.

They have diverted power around the underground cable fault.\n\nWe know some properties in the area may have faced other recent interruptions, and we're sorry for the extra disruption. Every outage is fully investigated by our engineers, though power may be lost several times before we can safely find and fix the issue. Our customer services team will keep as many customers updated as possible during these investigations. \n\nWe're sorry for the unplanned disruption.

Our engineers have now investigated the grounded overhead cabling, and have deemed it safe to restore power back to all 139 properties in the CO11 and CO7 area.\n\nWe're very sorry we had to turn your power off unexpectedly, and with so little warning. We usually provide much more notice if we can, but in a situation like this our first priority is the safety of the public and our staff.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage.

We understand how difficult a power cut can be, we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.",
