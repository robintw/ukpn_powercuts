Today's power cut was an unexpected overhead network fault that affected 671 properties, so I'm sorry that we weren't able to provide you with prior notice. I'm pleased to report our staff have resolved this by repairing the issue to get your lights back on as soon as possible.\n\nWe contact customers when we are made aware of problems like this, so if you would like to be notified in future let us know here https://bit.ly/3zyHC6L\n\nI personally apologise for the disruption this caused you. We aim to provide a 10/10 service in keeping you updated, so if you'd like to talk to us about anything or are still without power, please call us on 105.",

The issue was caused by an overhead network fault, which our engineers have now repaired. \n\nUsually we would send more frequent updates, so we apologise that due to the bad weather we have been unable to text as often. Storm Claudia has impacted our network with heavy rain, and we're dealing with a larger amount of power cuts than usual. \n\nWe know that being without power can be very worrying, so we're sorry for the outage.

We know your power may have been off for a long time, so we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on.

We know a power cut can be difficult, especially in colder weather.\n\nMany properties have gas hobs, which can still be used in a power cut for cooking, or heating water for drinks and sterilisation of baby bottles. The spark to ignite the hob will not work however, so if you do use it please take extra care when using other ignition sources like matches or lighters. Even in daytime, the light in your house may be low in a power cut, so only do this if you are confident it can be done safely.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns, our team are always on hand to help.",

Our engineers had to unexpectedly turn off the power to 206 customers in the Bentley, IP9 2 area to safely repair a fault on our overhead cabling network.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

This means we have been able to restore power sooner than we anticipated, we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.",

In addition to this, they are liaising closely with our control room to find safe and reliable ways to divert power around any problems and get everyone restored.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them. We'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",

I'm sorry for the power cut today; I know the lights going off can be disruptive.\n\nWe know that some customers affected by todays power cut may have had other issues recently, and I appreciate this is frustrating. High voltage cabling can cover a wide area, so sometimes properties very close to you may have had power cuts that you didn't experience.\n\nI know you may not have had any previous power cuts, but if you have, we often get progress updates from our field staff management about investigations into repeat issues, and our Customer Services team will try to contact everyone affected by them to explain what's happening.",

Specialist engineers are also working to divert power remotely, and this can cause your lights to go on and off.\n\nUsing an average timescale for this type of issue we're looking to have you back on between 15:30 and 16:30, however we must stress that this time may change, depending on what our staff find. We'll continue to update you with all of our progress.\n\nSent by Lisa at 14:16.",

Our customer services team will keep as many customers updated as possible during these investigations. \n\nWe're sorry for the unplanned disruption.

They may also walk our cabling route throughout the area to check for any visible problems, check smaller electrical sites in the area, or apply specialist equipment which may restore power temporarily to help them with their testing.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nWe'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",

There are now only 2 properties without power, who we'll speak to directly. If you're without power and haven't been contacted, then we'll need to hear from you. Please call us on 08003163105 (free from landlines and mobiles).\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the unexpected outage.
