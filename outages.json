Our contractors have advised us that the 198 affected properties will be restored early at approximately 11:00. This is following concerns from a local primary school that has gone off supply, so our engineers are looking to restore supplies as soon as possible to minimise the impact to them and affected customers. We can confirm that once power has been restored to the area that the works to test a transformer on Faygate Lane will be completed which will improve the reliability of the network and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut in the future. Our reference number for this work is INCD-326602-U. I hope that the power coming on earlier is of benefit to you.

        "Comment": "Good morning, this is a message from Ryan at UK Power Networks regarding the planned power cut which is currently in progress today the 5th of November 2025 in the RH12 postcode area. Our contractors have advised us that the 198 affected properties will be restored early at approximately 11:00. This is following concerns from a local primary school that has gone off supply, so our engineers are looking to restore supplies as soon as possible to minimise the impact to them and affected customers. We can confirm that once power has been restored to the area that the works to test a transformer on Faygate Lane will be completed which will improve the reliability of the network and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut in the future. Our reference number for this work is INCD-326602-U. I hope that the power coming on earlier is of benefit to you. We always aim to provide a 10/10 service, if you feel we have not delivered you a 10/10 service then please call us on 105.",

This has identified 15 cables and 3 poles that need upgrading. Doing this will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut in the future as we appreciate you may have been impacted by an unplanned fault in the last 6 months. To complete the work safely, we need to turn your power off to upgrade the equipment. To ensure the power is off for the shortest possible time, our contractors Avidety may carry out preparation works prior to the power cut. Avidety will need access to the inside of your property to conduct safety checks in the morning before we switch off the power and we will need to do another check when we turn the power back on. This work is taking place near Westward Lane. A road closure will be in place to allow the work to be carried out safely. Access to your property will always be provided.",

Please only attempt this if you are confident it can be done safely.\n\nIf you have someone in the property who may be more vulnerable to the cold please do not hesitate to call us free on 105.\n\nWe will do our best to provide additional care and support whilst work continues to get your power back on ASAP.",

They may also walk our cabling route throughout the area to check for any visible problems, check smaller electrical sites in the area, or apply specialist equipment which may restore power temporarily to help them with their testing.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nWe'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",

We have now restored power to all but one property. We're sorry for any disruption this unexpected power cut caused.\n\nIf your power isn't back on, we'd still like to keep you updated. If we aren't currently in contact with you by phone or in person at your property, please call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage and how long you were off for.

This means we have been able to restore power sooner than we anticipated, we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on.

Thanks for your patience today, our field staff and control room engineers have worked to get your power back on as quickly as they can.\n\nOur records show that some properties affected by today's power cut may have had other unexpected interruptions recently. If you have, we're sorry for further disruption. All power cuts are fully investigated by our engineers but can sometimes happen multiple times before we can safely find the issue and fix it.\n\nWe know that not everyone affected by today's power cut will have had other power cuts recently, but we want you to know that if you have, our customer services team will try to update as many customers as possible about our investigations.",

We believe the issue is an underground cable fault that initially interrupted power to 1364 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 38 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 10:30-11:30, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

Thanks for your patience today, our field staff and control room engineers have worked to get your power back on as quickly as they can.\n\nOur records show that some properties affected by today's power cut may have had other unexpected interruptions recently. If you have, we're sorry for further disruption. All power cuts are fully investigated by our engineers but can sometimes happen multiple times before we can safely find the issue and fix it.\n\nWe know that not everyone affected by today's power cut will have had other power cuts recently, but we want you to know that if you have, our customer services team will try to update as many customers as possible about our investigations.",

We believe the issue is  that initially interrupted power to 317 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 112 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 14:30-15:30, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

We have now restored power to all but one property. We're sorry for any disruption this unexpected power cut caused.\n\nIf your power isn't back on, we'd still like to keep you updated. If we aren't currently in contact with you by phone or in person at your property, please call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",
