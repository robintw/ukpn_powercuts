Excavations can sometimes take longer than expected, depending on ground conditions, other utility equipment like gas and water pipes, parked vehicles, or local traffic.\n\nAt the moment our estimated time frame of 02:00-03:00 hasn't changed, but as our staff are busy working with live electricity we need to wait until they can safely stop work and contact us with the latest information. Once they do, we'll update you further.\n\nOur team are always here if you have any questions.",
