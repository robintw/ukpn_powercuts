Our engineers have turned off the power in the Calcott Hill area in the interest of public safety. This is so they can make urgent repairs to a damaged pole and low hanging overhead cables, following a road traffic collision.\n\nIf in the area, please take care and stay at least 10m away from the cable. \n\nUntil our engineers arrive on site and investigate, it's difficult to advise you a time frame. However, based on an average for this kind of issue, our estimated time to have you back on is between 19:30 and 20:30. \n\nWe'll keep you updated with our progress, but in the meantime our team are always here to talk on 105 if you have any questions or concerns.",

The recent issues were being caused by an unexpected underground fault, which our engineers have repaired.\n\nWe know this has interrupted your power several times, and we're sorry the power cut today lasted longer than the others. We don't expect this issue to affect your power again, but we'll monitor the situation closely. Rest assured our staff will work around the clock to get your lights back on.\n\nIf your power isn't on, or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105, free from landlines and mobiles.",

They will start running tests at our substation to see how the local network is operating.\n\nIt's quite common for power to be restored briefly and go off again; this is our engineers using testing equipment to energise different sections of our network - this helps to narrow down any possible issues.\n\nOur cabling network is often broken down by smaller sites, and our staff may also check these to test for any problems, and they may also walk the cabling route to see if there are any signs of malfunction that have appeared on the surface. Our time frame hasn't been adjusted, so for now I'll let you know more news as soon as our staff update us.\n\nSent by Lisa at 22:16.",
