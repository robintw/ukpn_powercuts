Thanks for your patience over tonight.\n\nOur engineers have let us know that they have run into complications with the ongoing repair to the faulty overhead electrical equipment which is now hindering our progress to restore power. To give them time to do this safely, the estimated time frame to restore your power is now between 22:30 and 23:30.\n\nWe're sorry this is taking longer than expected, and we'll continue to keep you up to date, but if any change to this time comes in from our staff I'll let you know as soon as we hear.",

For now we have restored your power as quickly as we can.\n\nIf your power isn't on or you would like to talk to us, call us for free on 08003163105. We know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",

Our team of cable jointers have now identified the suspected section of faulted underground cabling using their specialist equipment.\n\nOur digging team are now starting excavations, but due to the surface material and how much space will be needed for our engineers to assess the fault and make their repairs safely, we're now estimating power will be back on by 13:30-14:30.\n\nWe're sorry to change our time frame, but we'll continue to keep you updated and our team are always here if you have any questions.",
