We want to be as transparent as possible as we know having multiple power cuts is disruptive and worrying, so I would like to help explain why we can't always fix a problem like this right away.\n\nUnderground electricity cabling is insulated for safety and if a fault develops, these materials can re-seal due to heat passing through them when our safety equipment operates and your power is lost. This covers any potential fault again, meaning our staff cannot locate it using their tests or specialist equipment.\n\nWe'll know more once our staff contact us again, so I'll be in touch again shortly.\n\nSent by Simon at 06:39.",

This is because every power cut increases the chance of the fault has developing to a point that our specialist teams can pinpoint it using specialist equipment. I'll let you know once our teams arrive.",

Thank you for your patience while our engineers continue repairs on the underground network in the High Street IP7 5 area, we've now restored power to most of the affected properties.

Please call us on 08003163105 (free from landlines and mobiles).\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the unexpected outage.

We know a power cut can be difficult, especially in colder weather.\n\nMany properties have gas hobs, which can still be used in a power cut for cooking, or heating water for drinks and sterilisation of baby bottles. The spark to ignite the hob will not work however, so if you do use it please take extra care when using other ignition sources like matches or lighters. Even in daytime, the light in your house may be low in a power cut, so only do this if you are confident it can be done safely.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns, our team are always on hand to help.",

        "Comment": "Sent by Talie at 22:05 - Our engineers have now restored power to all but three customers in the Artington, GU3 1, area, by diverting power around the grounded overhead cabling. We know power may have been off for a long time; we're sorry for any disruption this unplanned power cut caused.  \n\nWe know some properties in the area may have faced other recent interruptions, and we're sorry for the extra disruption. Every outage is fully investigated by our engineers, though power may be lost several times before we can safely find and fix the issue. Our customer services team will keep as many customers updated as possible during these investigations.\n\nTo talk to us, or let us know that your power isn't restored, call us on 08003163105.",

Currently the estimated time frame of 0300 - 0400 to have the power back on hasn't changed\n\nWith the cold weather, we understand that it can be very concerning to have a power cut as this may have affected your heating. If you have someone in the property who may be more vulnerable to the cold please do not hesitate to call us free on 105.\n\nWe will do our best to provide additional care and support whilst work continues to get your power back on asap.

We have already sent staff to the area, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting the electricity around the faulty section. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will locate and repair the issue, which will take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",

We didn't know this was going to happen, so time frames we provide throughout are estimated and are subject to change.\n\nOur estimated time to have power back on is currently between 03:30 and 04:30, but after we arrive and assess the situation this may change. The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",

For now we have restored your power as quickly as we can.\n\nIf your power isn't on or you would like to talk to us, call us for free on 08003163105. We know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",

We know power may have been off for a long time; we're sorry for any disruption this unplanned power cut caused.  \n\nWe know some properties in the area may have faced other recent interruptions, and we're sorry for the extra disruption. Every outage is fully investigated by our engineers, though power may be lost several times before we can safely find and fix the issue. Our customer services team will keep as many customers updated as possible during these investigations.\n\nTo talk to us, or let us know that your power isn't restored, call on 08003163105.",

As such, they have replaced our substation equipment to restore power as quickly as possible.\n\nI'm sorry this affected your power again today.
