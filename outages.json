We didn't know this was going to happen, so time frames we provide throughout are estimated and are subject to change.\n\nOur estimated time to have power back on is currently between 18:30 and 19:30, but after we arrive and assess the situation this may change. The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",

Our customer services team will keep as many customers updated as possible during these investigations. \n\nWe're sorry for the unplanned disruption.

Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 10:30-11:30, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

        "Comment": "Sent by Roland at 10:28 - Engineers are on their way. At this point we think the issue is a fault with equipment in your local substation in the Powis Square area. We didn't know this was going to happen, so time frames we provide throughout are estimated and are subject to change.\n\nOur estimated time to have power back on is currently between 13:30 and 14:30, but after we arrive and assess the situation this may change. The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",

However, due to the location and complexity of the issue, we have also used a temporary generator to restore power to the last of the affected properties. This will provide power until our engineers plan in and safely complete the full repair, which may take a few days.\n\nWe're really sorry for any disruption this unexpected power cut caused.

We know a power cut can be difficult, especially in colder weather.\n\nMany properties have gas hobs, which can still be used in a power cut for cooking, or heating water for drinks and sterilisation of baby bottles. The spark to ignite the hob will not work however, so if you do use it please take extra care when using other ignition sources like matches or lighters. Even in daytime, the light in your house may be low in a power cut, so only do this if you are confident it can be done safely.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns, our team are always on hand to help.",

Today's power cut was an unexpected overhead cable fault that affected 827 properties, so I'm sorry that we weren't able to provide you with prior notice. I'm pleased to report our staff have resolved this by diverting power to get your lights back on as soon as possible.\n\nWe contact customers when we are made aware of problems like this, so if you would like to be notified in future let us know here https://bit.ly/3zyHC6L\n\nI personally apologise for the disruption this caused you. We aim to provide a 10/10 service in keeping you updated, so if you'd like to talk to us about anything or are still without power, please call us on 105.",

They have diverted the power around a overhead network fault.\n\nWe know some properties may have faced other recent interruptions, and we're sorry for the extra disruption. Every outage is fully investigated by our engineers, though power may be lost several times before we can safely find and fix the issue. Our customer services team will keep as many customers updated as possible during these investigations. \n\nWe're sorry for the unplanned disruption. If you need to talk to us, or let us know that your power isn't restored, call us on 08003163105\n",
