Our engineers had to unexpectedly turn off the power to 95 customers in the Woodbridge, IP12 2 area to safely repair an overhead network fault.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

Engineers working in the area overnight came across some faulty cabling on our overhead network.\n\nSpecialist engineers were sent to the area to isolate additional power, which would allow them to repair the cabling safely. At this stage we're estimating to have the power back on between 06:30 and 07:30, however its possible this timeframe could change depending on how their repairs progress.\n\nWe'll continue to keep you updated but if you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to call us free on 105.

We have already sent staff to the area, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting the electricity around the faulty section. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will locate and repair the issue, which will take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",

We know a power cut can be difficult ; we're sorry for any disruption this unplanned power cut caused.  \n\nWe know some properties in the area may have faced other recent interruptions, and we're sorry for the extra disruption. Every outage is fully investigated by our engineers, though power may be lost several times before we can safely find and fix the issue. Our customer services team will keep as many customers updated as possible during these investigations.\n\nTo talk to us, or let us know that your power isn't restored, call us on 08003163105.\n\n",

We appreciate it can be unsettling to have a power cut during the night, but our engineers work 24 hours on issues like this so we're still aiming to have power restored as soon as possible.\n\nIf you light candles, please be mindful of them and take extra care when using the stairs.

Please only attempt this if you are confident it can be done safely.\n\nIf you have someone in the property who may be more vulnerable to the cold please do not hesitate to call us free on 105.\n\nWe will do our best to provide additional care and support whilst work continues to get your power back on ASAP.",
