To allow time for them to arrive and the repair work completed safely, we're now estimating to have the remaining power back on between 16:30 and 17:30.\n\nShould you have any concerns, please call us on 0800 316 3105, and our team will do their best to help.",

However, once they've assessed further we'll let you know if the time frame needs to change.\n\nFor more information about this type of fault; here's a short video https://bit.ly/2ScxQDZ - I'll keep you updated.",

However, once they've assessed further we'll let you know if the time frame needs to change.\n\nFor more information about this type of fault; here's a short video https://bit.ly/2ScxQDZ - I'll keep you updated.",

We have already sent staff to the area, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting the electricity around the faulty section. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will locate and repair the issue, which will take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",

We believe the issue is an underground cabling fault that initially interrupted power to 918 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 61 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 10:30-11:30, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

This means we have been able to restore power sooner than we anticipated, we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.\n",

Our engineers have now investigated the grounded overhead cable, and have deemed it safe to restore power back to all 116 properties in the ME3 7 area.\n\nWe're very sorry we had to turn your power off unexpectedly, and with so little warning. We usually provide much more notice if we can, but in a situation like this our first priority is the safety of the public and our staff.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. If your power is still off or if you have any questions, call our team on 08003163105.",
