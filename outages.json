        "Comment": "Good morning, this is a message from Harry at UK Power Networks regarding the planned power cut that is scheduled for today the 24th November 2025 in the CO9 postcode area. Our contractors have advised us that unfortunately there is going to be a delay in the power being switched off. This is due to faulty piece of electrical equipment which has delayed the start of the works. We now estimate to switch off your power between approximately 09:30 and 10:00. Our reference number for this work is INCD-23688-O. We would like to apologise for any inconvenience this may cause you. If you have any questions or you have moved from the CO9 postcode area, then please give us a call on 105.",

However, this could change once our staff have assessed the local network.\n\nWe believe the power cuts you have been experiencing are caused by a fault with one of the cables. Developing faults can start very small, and so can be hard to detect but each power cut usually makes it easier to see, which means our specialist staff can detect it, and work on the repair to prevent further outages.\n\nI'll let you know once our teams arrive.",

We believe the issue is  an underground fault that initially interrupted power to 4074 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 377 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe are currently estimating power will be on between 15:00 and 16:00 but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

We're arranging staff to attend ASAP, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting electricity. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to get as many customers back on as we can.\n\nOnce available, our engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, they will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will work to locate the issue and make repairs, which may take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing but we'll always give you the clearest information we have.",

Due to there being multiple power cuts over a short space of time, our engineers are going to start their tests at the nearby substation.\n\nOur current time frame is between 18:00 and 19:00; this is an estimate based on them checking the state of our network, and attempting to restore your power.\n\nIt's possible that the underground cabling fault we believe has been causing these power cuts has reach a point where they can't safely replace our substation equipment. If this happens we'll need to arrange further teams and equipment, so I'll let you know more news as soon as our staff update us. Sent by Adam at 13:35.",
