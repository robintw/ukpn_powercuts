Our staff have confirmed they have made repairs to the piece of overhead network equipment and managed to restore power to the Otford Lane TN14 7 area by approximately 01:16.\n\nWe apologise that this final update is delayed. After restoring supplies, our engineers first need to carry out essential safety tests before they are able to call us to confirm that everyone has been restored.\n\nWe're sorry for any disruption caused by this unexpected power cut, but if your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.

        "Comment": "Sent by Bev at 22:16 - Engineers are on their way. At this point we think the issue is a fault with equipment in your local substation in the Dunnock Close area. We didn't know this was going to happen, so time frames we provide throughout are estimated and are subject to change.\n\nOur estimated time to have power back on is currently between 01:30 and 02:30, but after we arrive and assess the situation this may change. The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",

This will allow them to cut our cable, and using specialist equipment, test each side to help narrow down where the fault lies.\n\nOur estimated time frame doesn't need to change currently, and we'll continue to keep you updated, but our team are always here on 08003163105 from any phone if you have any questions.

Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

They may also walk our cabling route throughout the area to check for any visible problems, check smaller electrical sites in the area, or apply specialist equipment which may restore power temporarily to help them with their testing.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nWe'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",

We didn't know this was going to happen, so time frames we provide throughout are estimated and are subject to change.\n\nOur estimated time to have power back on is currently between 03:30 and 04:30, but after we arrive and assess the situation this may change. The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",

We have already sent staff to the area, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting the electricity around the faulty section. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will locate and repair the issue, which will take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",

We believe the issue is an overhead cabling fault that initially interrupted power to 594 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 138 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 09:30-10:30, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?
