Our estimated time to have your power back on is between 2300 - 0000, however, this may need to change later depending on how our works progress.\n\nIf you'd like more information about why we sometimes have to switch power off to work; here's a short video https://bit.ly/3cYez0V.

They may also walk our cabling route throughout the area to check for any visible problems, check smaller electrical sites in the area, or apply specialist equipment which may restore power temporarily to help them with their testing.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nWe'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",

As power has now been restored our customer support vehicle will now attend another job.\n\nFor this reason, it's taken us longer than we expected to restore your power today. Please accept our sincere apology as we know that it is difficult to be without power for a longer duration.\n\nIf your power isn't back on, we'll need to hear from you. To talk to us about this or anything else, call us on 105 which is free from landlines and mobiles. We're really sorry for any disruption this caused.",

Our engineers have now repaired the overhead cables that had came down and replaced some equipment, and have deemed it safe to restore power back to all 262 properties in Iken, Sudbourne, IP12 2 area.\n\nWe're very sorry we had to turn your power off unexpectedly, and with so little warning. We usually provide much more notice if we can, but in a situation like this our first priority is the safety of the public and our staff.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage.

Our engineers had to unexpectedly turn off the power to 22 customers in the Bottisham, CB25 9  area to safely remove a tree from the overhead cables.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

Thanks for your patience today, our field staff and control room engineershave worked to get your power back on as quickly as they can.\n\nOur records show that some properties affected by today's power cut may have had other unexpected interruptions recently. If you have, we're sorry for further disruption. All power cuts are fully investigated by our engineers but can sometimes happen multiple times before we can safely find the issue and fix it.\n\nWe know that not everyone affected by today's power cut will have had other power cuts recently, but we want you to know that if you have, our customer services team will try to update as many customers as possible about our investigations.",

In addition to this, they are liaising closely with our control room to find safe and reliable ways to divert power around any problems and get everyone restored.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them. We'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",

        "Comment": "Sent by Lee at 21:14 - We can now confirm that all power in the Littleport, Feltwell, CB7 4 area should be back on. Our engineers have diverted power around an overhead network fault to get the majority of customers back on. However, due to the location and complexity of the issue, we have also used a temporary generator to restore power to the last of the affected properties. This will provide power until our engineers plan in and safely complete the full repair, which may take a few days.\n\nWe're really sorry for any disruption this unexpected power cut caused. If your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n",

Depending on the fault, it may take several days for our engineers to pinpoint the problem and plan in the work. The temporary generator will remain on site to provide power until we can locate the issue and restore the network back to normal running conditions.\n\nIf you'd like any further information, our team are always here to help.
