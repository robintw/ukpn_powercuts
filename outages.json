Thanks for bearing with us during the power cut, I know the lights being off is a worry.\n\nOur staff have advised that repairs are proving more complex than expected. Due to the delay this has caused, they've advised a new time of 19:00 and 20:00 to have your power back on.\n\nI know another delay is frustrating; our engineers always try to give us the best estimate that they can but due to the safety elements of working with live electricity, sometimes they have to adjust their repairs at short notice.\n\nI'm sorry if this has caused you to change any plans you've made, but we'll be here to update you until the lights are safely back on.",

The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",

        "Comment": "Sent by Will at 14:18 - Engineers are on their way. At this point we think the issue is a fault with equipment in your local substation in the Ewell Road area. We didn't know this was going to happen, so time frames we provide throughout are estimated and are subject to change.\n\nOur estimated time to have power back on is currently between 18:00 and 19:00, but after we arrive and assess the situation this may change. The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",

At this point we think the issue is a fault with some equipment connected to our overhead network in the Romney Marsh, TN29 9 area.

The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",

To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on.

At this point we think the issue is a fault with some equipment connected to our overhead network in the Romney Marsh, TN29 9 area. We didn't know this was going to happen, so time frames we provide throughout are estimated and are subject to change.\n\nOur estimated time to have power back on is currently between 17:30 and 18:30, but after we arrive and assess the situation this may change. The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",

We have now restored power to all but one property. We're sorry for any disruption this unexpected power cut caused.\n\nIf your power isn't back on, we'd still like to keep you updated. If we aren't currently in contact with you by phone or in person at your property, please call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",

The issue was caused by an unexpected fault with some of our network equipment, which our engineers have now replaced.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

        "Comment": "Sent by Luke at 20:38 - Engineers are on their way. At this point we think the issue is a fault with equipment in your local substation in the Hickmans Lane area. We didn't know this was going to happen, so time frames we provide throughout are estimated and are subject to change.\n\nOur estimated time to have power back on is currently between 00:00 and 01:00, but after we arrive and assess the situation this may change. The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",

This leaves 62 properties affected by the underground fault.\n\nOur staff are checking our equipment throughout the area to pinpoint the issue on our network. In addition to this, they are liaising closely with our control room to find safe and reliable ways to divert power around any problems and get everyone restored. \n\nYou may be worried about the food in your fridge and freezer. Food should keep for up to 6 hours in the fridge, and between 15-24 hours in the freezer if you can avoid opening them. \n\nIf your power is back on and you wish to stop receiving texts, just follow this link https://bit.ly/348KOZ3 to unsubscribe.",
