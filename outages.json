We believe our engineers have been able to restore power to the several thousand customers in the Canadian Avenue area by diverting power around a faulted piece of underground network equipment. We're pleased that we have been able to restore power sooner than we estimated.\n\nIf your power isn't back on, we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.",
