Depending on the fault, it may take several days for our engineers to pinpoint the problem and plan in the work. The temporary generators will remain on site to provide power until we can locate the issue and restore the network back to normal running conditions.\n\nIf you'd like any further information, our team are always here to help. \n\n",

For now we have restored your power as quickly as we can.\n\nIf your power isn't on or you would like to talk to us, call us for free on 08003163105.

They will start running tests at our substation to see how the local network is operating.\n\nIt's quite common for power to be restored briefly and go off again; this is our engineers using testing equipment to energise different sections of our network - this helps to narrow down any possible issues.\n\nOur cabling network is often broken down by smaller sites, and our staff may also check these to test for any problems, and they may also walk the cabling route to see if there are any signs of malfunction that have appeared on the surface. Our time frame hasn't been adjusted, so for now I'll let you know more news as soon as our staff update us.\n\nSent by Adam at 16:34.",

Our current estimated time frame to restore power is between 1900 - 2000, but this is based on our staff being able to restore your power by replacing the substation equipment.\n\nAs this has happened several times recently, it indicates a cabling fault. This may have reached a point where our safety equipment will not replace safely, meaning the fault has become visible. If this happens, we'll arrange further specialist teams to attend and repair it. I'll keep you updated.",

Our engineers turned off power to 173 properties for safety so they can investigate reports of a road traffic collision to an overhead electrical pole bringing the overhead cables low to the ground. They have now deemed it safe to restore all power to the properties affected. \n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the unexpected outage. Please rest our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",

Our estimated time to have your power back on is between 23:00 and 00:00, however, this may need to change later depending on how our works progress.\n\nIf you'd like more information about why we sometimes have to switch power off to work; here's a short video https://bit.ly/3cYez0V.

This is why a wide area has lost electricity.\n\nOur field teams are working to fix the issue as quickly as possible, and we'll start diverting power back to affected homes as soon as they advise us it's safe. You may notice your lights going on and off as we work to get as much power restored as we can.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",

We didn't know this was going to happen, so time frames we provide throughout are estimated and are subject to change.\n\nOur estimated time to have power back on is currently between 03:30 and 04:30, but after we arrive and assess the situation this may change. The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",

This means we have been able to restore power sooner than we anticipated, we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on.

We have already sent staff to the area, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting the electricity around the faulty section. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will locate and repair the issue, which will take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",

Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 05:00 and 06:00, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?
