To stop SMS updates, visit our website here - https://bit.ly/348KOZ3.\n\nIf your power is still affected, our engineers have been in touch to advise that investigations on the network are ongoing. Due to this, we're now estimating that we'll have the remaining power restored by 00:00-01:00.\n\nWe're very sorry to adjust our time frame, but we'll continue to keep you updated with all of our progress.",

The issue was caused by an unexpected underground cable fault, which our engineers have been able to isolate off the main network.\n\nWe know that a power cut can be difficult, and I'm sorry for the length of the time you were without your electricity. Please rest assured that our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",
