        "Comment": "Sent by Bev at 06:57 - I appreciate your continued patience during the power cut today. Our staff are working as quickly as they can to get the lights back on, and they've advised us that there are now 220 properties still affected.\n\nThey have managed to get a further 34 of our customers back on by diverting electricity, so your power may have come on sooner than we originally advised.\n\nIf you're still off, please don't worry; work on the issue will continue along with SMS updates until everyone is back on.\n\nTo stop receiving texts, just follow this link https://bit.ly/348KOZ3 to unsubscribe.",

They may also walk our cabling route throughout the area to check for any visible problems, check smaller electrical sites in the area, or apply specialist equipment which may restore power temporarily to help them with their testing.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice.

Today's power cut was an unexpected underground cable fault that affected 3134 properties, so I'm sorry that we weren't able to provide you with prior notice. I'm pleased to report our staff have resolved this by diverting power to get your lights back on as soon as possible.\n\nWe contact customers when we are made aware of problems like this, so if you would like to be notified in future let us know here https://bit.ly/3zyHC6L\n\nI personally apologise for the disruption this caused you. We aim to provide a 10/10 service in keeping you updated, so if you'd like to talk to us about anything or are still without power, please call us on 105.",

Our staff have confirmed they have diverted the power around an underground cable fault and managed to restore power to the IP4 3, IP4 5, IP5 1, IP5 2, IP6 9 area by approximately 2139\n\nWe apologise that this final update is delayed. After restoring supplies, our engineers first need to carry out essential safety tests before they are able to call us to confirm that everyone has been restored.\n\nWe're sorry for any disruption caused by this unexpected power cut, but if your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.

This means we have been able to restore power sooner than we anticipated, we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.\n",

By doing this, we've managed to restore power to 305 customers. There are now 121 properties still affected.\n\nWe'll keep sending SMS updates until everybody is restored.

We believe our engineers have been able to restore power to all 81 customers in the NR34 7 area, by diverting power around a faulted piece of underground network equipment. This means we have been able to restore power sooner than we anticipated, we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.",

If you need any additional support or have any concerns, please call us on 105 or tweet us @ukpowernetworks.\n\nI will personally continue to keep you updated with our progress.",

In addition to this, they are liaising closely with our control room to find safe and reliable ways to divert power around any problems and get everyone restored.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice.
