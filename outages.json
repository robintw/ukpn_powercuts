Our estimated time to have your power back on is between 17:00 and 18:00, however, this may need to change later depending on how our works progress.\n\nIf you'd like more information about why we sometimes have to switch power off to work; here's a short video https://bit.ly/3cYez0V. We'll keep you updated with progress.",

Please accept our sincere apology as we know that it is difficult to be without power for a longer duration.\n\nIf your power isn't back on, we'll need to hear from you. To talk to us about this or anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles. We're really sorry for any disruption this caused.",
