To provide a reliable electricity supply to your property, we carry out regular inspections of our equipment in your area. We have found a faulty piece of equipment called switchgear within one of our substations that needs replacing, which controls and protects the electricity network. To minimise the impact to affected customers we will be carrying out this work overnight. Our engineers need to temporarily switch off your power so we can safely carry out the work. Doing this will improve the reliability of the network and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut in the future. This work is taking place on Eldon Way.",

They have diverted the power around a underground network fault.\n\nWe know some properties in the area may have faced other recent interruptions, and we're sorry for the extra disruption. Every outage is fully investigated by our engineers, though power may be lost several times before we can safely find and fix the issue. Our customer services team will keep as many customers updated as possible during these investigations. \n\nWe're sorry for the unplanned disruption. If you need to talk to us, or let us know that your power isn't restored, call us on 08003163105.\n",

We have now restored power to all but one property, following the property fire. We're sorry for any disruption this unexpected power cut caused.\n\nIf your power isn't back on, we'd still like to keep you updated. If we aren't currently in contact with you by phone or in person at your property, please call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage.

Our engineers have turned off the power in the Harlow CM17 0/CM20 2 area in the interest of the public's health and safety. This is after receiving a request from the fire service, due to a property fire.\n\nAt this stage, it's difficult to advise you a time frame. However, based on an average for this kind of issue, our estimated time to have you back on is between 10:00 and 11:00. \n\nWe'll keep you updated with our progress, but in the meantime our team are always here to talk on 105 if you have any questions or concerns.",

This is why a wide area has lost electricity.\n\nOur field teams are working to fix the issue as quickly as possible, and we'll start diverting power back to affected homes as soon as they advise us it's safe. You may notice your lights going on and off as we work to get as much power restored as we can.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",
