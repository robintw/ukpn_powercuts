The issue was caused by an unexpected fault with some of our network equipment, which our engineers have now replaced.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

They may also walk our cabling route throughout the area to check for any visible problems, check smaller electrical sites in the area, or apply specialist equipment which may restore power temporarily to help them with their testing.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nWe'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",

This means we have been able to restore power sooner than we anticipated, we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on.

There are now only 2 properties without power, who we'll speak to directly. If you're without power and haven't been contacted, then we'll need to hear from you. Please call us on 08003163105 (free from landlines and mobiles).\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the unexpected outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",

If you have, we're sorry for further disruption. All power cuts are fully investigated by our engineers but can sometimes happen multiple times before we can safely find the issue and fix it.\n\nWe know that not everyone affected by today's power cut will have had other power cuts recently, but we want you to know that if you have, our customer services team will try to update as many customers as possible about our investigations.",

We believe the issue is an overhead network fault that initially interrupted power to 1734 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 264 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 10:30-11:30, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

We have already sent staff to the area, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting the electricity around the faulty section. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will locate and repair the issue, which will take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",

The issue was caused by an unexpected underground cable fault, which our engineers have made repairs to.\n\nWe know that a power cut can be difficult, and I'm sorry for the length of the time you were without your electricity. Please rest assured that our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",
