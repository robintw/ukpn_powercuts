However, it was only necessary to interrupt power to some of these properties for a short while, so you might find your power only went off briefly.\n\nIf this is the case and your power is back on now, you can unsubscribe from the SMS service through our website, here - https://bit.ly/348KOZ3\n\nWe also know your power may still be affected, and if so we apologise but we'll keep you updated with all of our progress.
