There are now only 2 properties without power, who we'll speak to directly. If you're without power and haven't been contacted, then we'll need to hear from you. Please call us on 08003163105 (free from landlines and mobiles).\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the unexpected outage.

They may also walk our cabling route throughout the area to check for any visible problems, check smaller electrical sites in the area, or apply specialist equipment which may restore power temporarily to help them with their testing.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nWe'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",

Using an average timescale for this type of issue, we're looking to have you back on between 21:30 and 22:30, however we must stress that this time may change, depending on what our staff find.\n\nWe know that a power cut can be very disruptive; we understand this can greatly impact your daily activities and we want to support you however we can.

I'm pleased to report our staff have resolved this by diverting power to get your lights back on as soon as possible.\n\nWe contact customers when we are made aware of problems like this, so if you would like to be notified in future let us know here https://bit.ly/3zyHC6L\n\nI personally apologise for the disruption this caused you.

We believe the issue is an overhead network fault that initially interrupted power to 2658 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 236 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 10:30-11:30, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

We understand how difficult a power cut can be, we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on.

We're arranging staff to attend ASAP, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting electricity. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to get as many customers back on as we can.\n\nOnce available, our engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, they will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will work to locate the issue and make repairs, which may take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing but we'll always give you the clearest information we have.",

This can make it difficult to locate, so while our engineers are testing our equipment thoroughly to pinpoint the issue, this kind of problem may interrupt power multiple times before it's possible for us to fix.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nI'll keep you updated. Sent by Adam at 13:10",

As such, they have replaced our substation equipment to restore power as quickly as possible.\n\nI'm sorry this affected your power again today. This may happen again before we're able to pinpoint the issue and fix it, but if you'd like to talk to us about anything or if your power isn't on, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

        "Comment": "We're sorry your power has gone off again.\n\nWe believe there may be an underlying issue causing the recent power cuts, but due to the nature of the electricity network, the heat created by a developing fault can cause a break in a cable to reseal itself. This can make it difficult to locate, so while our engineers are testing our equipment thoroughly to pinpoint the issue, this kind of problem may interrupt power multiple times before it's possible for us to fix.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nI'll keep you updated. Sent by Adam at 13:10",

They may also walk our cabling route throughout the area to check for any visible problems, check smaller electrical sites in the area, or apply specialist equipment which may restore power temporarily to help them with their testing.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nWe'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",

We didn't know this was going to happen, so time frames we provide throughout are estimated and are subject to change.\n\nOur estimated time to have power back on is currently between 19:30 and 20:30, but after we arrive and assess the situation this may change. The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",

We understand how difficult a power cut can be, we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.\n\n",

This can make it difficult to locate, so while our engineers are testing our equipment thoroughly to pinpoint the issue, this kind of problem may interrupt power multiple times before it's possible for us to fix.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice.

For now we have restored your power as quickly as we can.\n\nIf your power isn't on or you would like to talk to us, call us for free on 08003163105.

This can make it difficult to locate, so while our engineers are testing our equipment thoroughly to pinpoint the issue, this kind of problem may interrupt power multiple times before it's possible for us to fix.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nI'll keep you updated. Sent by Simon at 18:19",

As there have been other power cuts recently it's difficult to know what repairs will be needed to restore your power safely, so time frames we provide throughout have to be estimated.\n\nThe results of our engineer's tests on our network will let us know if our estimate needs to be adjusted, so we'll update you as soon as they have arrived on site and investigated.",

We believe there may be a fault on our underground electricity cabling in the area, but currently it has not developed to a stage that our staff can pinpoint it. Their tests have proven inconclusive, so for now they have replaced our safety equipment at the substation to get your power back on as quickly as possible.\n\nThis may happen again before we're able to fix it, but if you'd like to talk to us about this, or if your power isn't on call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",
