I'm very sorry you're still without power.\n\nOur engineers have been working hard to get you back on but they have advised that the temporary generators are now on site in the Collingford Lane but due to complications with the connection of them to restore your power. We now need to send out a relief team first thing this morning to carry on with the work. Due to this we have had to change the estimated timeframe to between 12:00-13:00.  This means that you may not receive any texts for a while.\n\nWe'll let you know as soon as our staff re-attend and we have some more information, but if you have any concerns in the meantime you can always reach our team here on 105.",

We appreciate it can be unsettling to have a power cut during the night, but our engineers work 24 hours on issues like this so we're still aiming to have power restored as soon as possible.\n\nIf you light candles, please be mindful of them and take extra care when using the stairs.

Our engineers have just called in to advise us that they have found an overhead cable laying on the ground in the NR19 2 area, which they are working on repairing and re erecting the cable to be able to restore your power.\n\nUnfortunately, it's going to take us past our current time frame to complete this safely, so we're now working towards between 04:30 and 05:30 to have power back on.\n\nWe can appreciate how frustrating and disruptive being without power can be, and our staff are working as fast as they can. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to speak to our team, but I'll let you know further news as it comes in from site. Sent by David at 02:55.",

        "Comment": "Sent by Will at 18:15 - Engineers are on their way. At this point we think the issue is a fault with equipment in your local substation in the Grafton Road area. We didn't know this was going to happen, so time frames we provide throughout are estimated and are subject to change.\n\nOur estimated time to have power back on is currently between 21:30 and 22:30, but after we arrive and assess the situation this may change. The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",

They may also walk our cabling route throughout the area to check for any visible problems, check smaller electrical sites in the area, or apply specialist equipment which may restore power temporarily to help them with their testing.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nWe'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",

Please only attempt this if you are confident it can be done safely.\n\nIf you have someone in the property who may be more vulnerable to the cold please do not hesitate to call us free on 105.\n\nWe will do our best to provide additional care and support whilst work continues to get your power back on ASAP.",

        "Comment": "Hi, Talie from the messaging team here; just a quick recap on what's happened during the power cut so far. Our engineers are still working to repair an overhead cable that has come down onto the ground in the Old Crawley Road area. We have managed to get power restored to 461 properties, so currently 81 properties are still affected by the repairs.\n\nWe are still aiming to have the power back on between 21:00-22:00. If your power is back on now, please follow this link https://bit.ly/348KOZ3 to stop SMS updates.\n\nI'm sorry for the continued disruption, but I'll keep you informed with news from site. If you have any concerns, please call us on 08003163105.",

Our engineers previously diverted electricity around the fault, however this diversion has not held.

Our staff are working as quickly as they can to get the lights back on, and they've advised us that there are now 72 properties still affected.\n\nThey have managed to get a further 12 of our customers back on by diverting electricity, so your power may have come on sooner than we originally advised.\n\nIf you're still off, please don't worry; work on the issue will continue along with SMS updates until everyone is back on.\n\nTo stop receiving texts, just follow this link https://bit.ly/348KOZ3 to unsubscribe.",
