Our engineers have advised that they have been able to replace one of the damaged overhead poles and are working on the 2nd one now. Once they are both erected we will work on connecting the overhead cables that are laying on the ground to the new overhead poles that will restore your power. At the moment we don't need to change the estimated timeframe.\n\nIf you have a vulnerable person at home, please call us on 08003163105 and we'll see if we can provide any additional support.",

Due to there being multiple power cuts over a short space of time, our engineers are going to start their tests at the nearby substation.\n\nOur current time frame is between 18:00 and 19:00 this is an estimate based on them checking the state of our network, and attempting to restore your power.\n\nIt's possible that the underground cabling fault we believe has been causing these power cuts has reach a point where they can't safely replace our substation equipment. If this happens we'll need to arrange further teams and equipment, so I'll let you know more news as soon as our staff update us. Sent by Aaron at 14:53.",

For now we have restored your power as quickly as we can.\n\nIf your power isn't on or you would like to talk to us, call us for free on 08003163105.

Due to there being multiple power cuts over a short space of time, our engineers are going to start their tests at the nearby substation.\n\nOur current time frame is between 00:30 and 01:30; this is an estimate based on them checking the state of our network, and attempting to restore your power.\n\nIt's possible that the underground cabling fault we believe has been causing these power cuts has reach a point where they can't safely replace our substation equipment.

They may also walk our cabling route throughout the area to check for any visible problems, check smaller electrical sites in the area, or apply specialist equipment which may restore power temporarily to help them with their testing.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nWe'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",

There are now only 3 properties without power, who we'll speak to directly. If you're without power and haven't been contacted, then we'll need to hear from you. Please call us on 08003163105 (free from landlines and mobiles).\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the unexpected outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.",

By doing this, we've managed to restore power to 2153 customers. There are now 362 properties still affected and using an average time frame we're estimating all power will be on between 17:30 and 18:30, but this may change later depending on what our staff find.\n\nWe'll keep sending SMS updates until everybody is restored.

Our engineers have now safely connected temporary generators and these will be providing your power while our engineers work to fully repair the unexpected high voltage fault.\n\nDepending on what the issue is, it may take a few days for our engineers to plan in the work and make their repairs, but once this is completed safely the generators can be removed, and network power will be resumed.\n\nIf you'd like any further information, or if your power is not restored, please call us any time on 08003163105.",
