Our engineers have advised us that the 10 affected properties will be restored early between approximately 13:15-13:30 as the works have progressed better than expected. We can confirm that once power has been restored to the area that the works for a third party to trim trees around 1 section of overhead cables near The Ridge will be completed which will adhere to the customer request and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut in the future. Our reference number for this work is INCD-105820-C. I hope that the power coming on earlier is of benefit to you.

        "Comment": "Good afternoon, this is a message from Ryan at UK Power Networks regarding the planned power cut which is currently in progress today the 18th of December 2025 in the CM3 postcode area. Our engineers have advised us that the 10 affected properties will be restored early between approximately 13:15-13:30 as the works have progressed better than expected. We can confirm that once power has been restored to the area that the works for a third party to trim trees around 1 section of overhead cables near The Ridge will be completed which will adhere to the customer request and reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut in the future. Our reference number for this work is INCD-105820-C. I hope that the power coming on earlier is of benefit to you. We always aim to provide a 10/10 service, if you feel we have not delivered you a 10/10 service then please call us on 105.",

We need to examine a transformer on our electricity poles to check it is functioning properly. This essential work helps to provide a reliable electricity supply to your property, reducing the risk of any unplanned power cuts in the future.

We are taking extra measures to limit the time your power is off and we'll do our best to cause as little disruption as possible. Doing this will improve the reliability of the electricity network in the future as we appreciate you may have been impacted by an unplanned power cut in the last 6 months.

Using an average timescale for this type of issue, we're looking to have you back on between 16:30 and 17:30, however we must stress that this time may change, depending on what our staff find.\n\nWe know that a power cut can be very disruptive; we understand this can greatly impact your daily activities and we want to support you however we can. We'll update you with all of our progress, but for more information about this type of fault; here's a short YouTube video https://bit.ly/2y8Dtfz. Sent by Adam at 13:14.",
