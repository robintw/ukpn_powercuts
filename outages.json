Our contractors have advised us that there is going to be a delay in the power being switched off and the generator being connected this morning due to a missing generator lead. Our contractors now estimate for the power to be switched off between approximately 08:45 to 09:30. Our reference number for this work is INCD-106236-C. We would like to apologise for any inconvenience this may cause you. If you have any questions or you have moved from the LU3 postcode area, then please call 105. Thank you. VB & SMS sent.",

Our estimated time to have your power back on is between 21:00 and 22:00, however, this may need to change later depending on how our works progress.\n\nIf you'd like more information about why we sometimes have to switch power off to work; here's a short video https://bit.ly/3cYez0V.

The issue was caused by an unexpected fault with some of our network equipment, which our engineers have now replaced.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

They may also walk our cabling route throughout the area to check for any visible problems, check smaller electrical sites in the area, or apply specialist equipment which may restore power temporarily to help them with their testing.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nWe'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",

We believe there may be a fault on our underground electricity cabling in the area, but currently it has not developed to a stage that our staff can pinpoint it. Their tests have proven inconclusive, so for now they have replaced our safety equipment at the substation to get your power back on as quickly as possible.\n\nThis may happen again before we're able to fix it, but if you'd like to talk to us about this, or if your power isn't on call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

We want to be as transparent as possible as we know having multiple power cuts is disruptive and worrying, so I would like to help explain why we can't always fix a problem like this right away.\n\nUnderground electricity cabling is insulated for safety and if a fault develops, these materials can re-seal due to heat passing through them when our safety equipment operates and your power is lost. This covers any potential fault again, meaning our staff cannot locate it using their tests or specialist equipment.\n\nWe'll know more once our staff contact us again, so I'll be in touch again shortly.\n\nSent by Lee at 08:31.",

They will start running tests at our substation to see how the local network is operating.\n\nIt's quite common for power to be restored briefly and go off again; this is our engineers using testing equipment to energise different sections of our network - this helps to narrow down any possible issues.\n\nOur cabling network is often broken down by smaller sites, and our staff may also check these to test for any problems, and they may also walk the cabling route to see if there are any signs of malfunction that have appeared on the surface. Our time frame hasn't been adjusted, so for now I'll let you know more news as soon as our staff update us.\n\nSent by Lee at 08:09.",

They will then check our network equipment throughout the area to try and identify any problems, before trying to restore power.\n\nOur estimated time frame of 12:00-13:00 hasn't changed, but if this is not successful it's possible that a cable repair may be needed. This can involve ground excavations, traffic management equipment or specialist teams. As soon as our staff can safely update us, we'll give you the latest news. Sent by Stuart at 08:18.\n",

We are sending our engineers back to the High Street area to investigate why.\n\nCurrently, our time frame for power to be restored is between 12:00 and 13:00, but once our staff arrive on site and assess the situation, this time may change. As there have been other power cuts recently it's difficult to know what repairs will be needed to restore your power safely, so time frames we provide throughout have to be estimated.\n\nThe results of our engineer's tests on our network will let us know if our estimate needs to be adjusted, so we'll update you as soon as they have arrived on site and investigated.",

        "Comment": "Sent by Bev at 09:30 - Engineers are on their way. At this point we think the issue is a fault with equipment in your local substation in the Green Street area. We didn't know this was going to happen, so time frames we provide throughout are estimated and are subject to change.\n\nOur estimated time to have power back on is currently between 12:30 and 13:30, but after we arrive and assess the situation this may change. The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",
