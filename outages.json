To get your power back on today we have reconfigured the local electricity network.

Our engineers have turned off the power in the Calcott Hill area in the interest of public safety. This is so they can make urgent repairs to a damaged pole and low hanging overhead cables, following a road traffic collision.\n\nIf in the area, please take care and stay at least 10m away from the cable. \n\nUntil our engineers arrive on site and investigate, it's difficult to advise you a time frame. However, based on an average for this kind of issue, our estimated time to have you back on is between 19:30 and 20:30. \n\nWe'll keep you updated with our progress, but in the meantime our team are always here to talk on 105 if you have any questions or concerns.",

        "Comment": "Sent by Will at 21:23 - We believe our engineers have been able to restore power to several thousand customers, by diverting power around an underground network fault. This means we have been able to restore power sooner than we anticipated, we're sorry for any disruption or worry this unplanned power cut caused you.   \n\nIf your power isn't back on we'll need to hear from you. To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on. If you have any concerns or questions, give us a call any time.",
