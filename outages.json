Our contractors have advised that unfortunately there is going to be a delay in restoring your power. This is due to technical difficulties on site which have slowed down the progression of the works. We now estimate to restore your power between approximately 17:30-18:30. Please note that this is an estimated timeframe so your power may come on sooner. Our reference number for this work is INCD-560629-Z. We would like to apologise for any inconvenience this may cause you. If you have any questions or you have moved from the LU6 postcode area, then please call 105.",

The power was switched off in stages by 12:09 to enable our contractors to run some essential checks on a piece of equipment called a transformer near Whitegates Lane. Our contractors have advised us that works have progressed well and the 38 affected properties will be restored early in stages by 13:30.  Once completed and power has been restored to the area, this has improved the reliability of the electricity network, ensured the equipment is running to the best of its ability and reduced the risk of you having an unplanned power cut. Our reference number for this work is INCD-326741-U. I hope that the power coming on earlier is of benefit to you. We always aim to provide a 10/10 service, if you feel we have not delivered you a 10/10 service then please call us on 105.",

        "Comment": "Good afternoon, this is a message from Donna at UK Power Networks regarding the planned power cut which is currently in progress today the 17th November 2025 in the TN5 postcode area. The power was switched off in stages by 12:09 to enable our contractors to run some essential checks on a piece of equipment called a transformer near Whitegates Lane. Our contractors have advised us that works have progressed well and the 38 affected properties will be restored early in stages by 13:30.  Once completed and power has been restored to the area, this has improved the reliability of the electricity network, ensured the equipment is running to the best of its ability and reduced the risk of you having an unplanned power cut. Our reference number for this work is INCD-326741-U. I hope that the power coming on earlier is of benefit to you. We always aim to provide a 10/10 service, if you feel we have not delivered you a 10/10 service then please call us on 105.",

If you have, we're sorry for further disruption. All power cuts are fully investigated by our engineers but can sometimes happen multiple times before we can safely find the issue and fix it.\n\nWe know that not everyone affected by today's power cut will have had other power cuts recently, but we want you to know that if you have, our customer services team will try to update as many customers as possible about our investigations.",

There are now only 4 properties without power, who we'll speak to directly. If you're without power and haven't been contacted, then we'll need to hear from you. Please call us on 08003163105 (free from landlines and mobiles).\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the unexpected outage.

Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 20:30-21:30, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

Today's power cut was an unexpected overhead network fault that affected 2303 properties, so I'm sorry that we weren't able to provide you with prior notice. I'm pleased to report our staff have resolved this by diverting power to get your lights back on as soon as possible.\n\nWe contact customers when we are made aware of problems like this, so if you would like to be notified in future let us know here https://bit.ly/3zyHC6L\n\nI personally apologise for the disruption this caused you. We aim to provide a 10/10 service in keeping you updated, so if you'd like to talk to us about anything or are still without power, please call us on 105.",

We believe the issue is an overhead network fault that initially interrupted power to 2303 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 208 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 20:30-21:30, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

We have already sent staff to the area, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting the electricity around the faulty section. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to restore as much power as we can.\n\nThe engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will locate and repair the issue, which will take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing, but we'll always try to give you the clearest information we have.",

To report this, or to talk to us about anything else, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be worrying, but please rest assured that our staff work around the clock to keep the lights on.
