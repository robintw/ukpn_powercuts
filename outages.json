        "Comment": "Our engineers have just called in to advise us that in order to continue their works on the underground network fault safely, they will need to turn off power to further properties in the area.\n\nUnfortunately, it's going to take us past our current time frame to complete this safely, so we're now working towards between 21:00 and 22:00 to have power back on.\n\nWe can appreciate how frustrating and disruptive being without power can be, and our staff are working as fast as they can. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to speak to our team, but I'll let you know further news as it comes in from site. Sent by Lisa at 16:42.",

To give the team time to complete their repairs, we're now aiming to have power back on between 04:00 and 05:00.\n\nIf you'd like more information about why we sometimes have to switch power off to work; here's a short video https://bit.ly/3cYez0V. We're sorry to have to change the timeframe and we'll keep you updated with progress.",
