Please call us on 08003163105 (free from landlines and mobiles).\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the unexpected outage.

They may also walk our cabling route throughout the area to check for any visible problems, check smaller electrical sites in the area, or apply specialist equipment which may restore power temporarily to help them with their testing.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nWe'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",

Our engineers have now investigated the low overhead cable, and have deemed it safe to restore power back to all 162 properties in the Uckfield TN22 area.\n\nWe're very sorry we had to turn your power off unexpectedly, and with so little warning. We usually provide much more notice if we can, but in a situation like this our first priority is the safety of the public and our staff.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. If your power is still off or if you have any questions, call our team on 08003163105.",

I'm sorry that we've had to change the time frame* However, I will personally be keeping an eye on this, and I'll continue to update you with further news.",

They have repaired and re attached the overhead cables that were laying on the ground.\n\nWe know some properties in the area may have faced other recent interruptions, and we're sorry for the extra disruption. Every outage is fully investigated by our engineers, though power may be lost several times before we can safely find and fix the issue. Our customer services team will keep as many customers updated as possible during these investigations. \n\nWe're sorry for the unplanned disruption. If you need to talk to us, or let us know that your power isn't restored, call us on 08003163105.",

They will start running tests at our substation to see how the local network is operating.\n\nIt's quite common for power to be restored briefly and go off again; this is our engineers using testing equipment to energise different sections of our network - this helps to narrow down any possible issues.\n\nOur cabling network is often broken down by smaller sites, and our staff may also check these to test for any problems, and they may also walk the cabling route to see if there are any signs of malfunction that have appeared on the surface. Our time frame hasn't been adjusted, so for now I'll let you know more news as soon as our staff update us.\n\nSent by Theo at 16:28.",

As there have been other power cuts recently it's difficult to know what repairs will be needed to restore your power safely, so time frames we provide throughout have to be estimated.\n\nThe results of our engineer's tests on our network will let us know if our estimate needs to be adjusted, so we'll update you as soon as they have arrived on site and investigated.",

They will also check smaller sites which run along our cabling route, these break our network down into smaller sections and can help pinpoint any possible problems.\n\nOur estimated time frame of between 21:00 and 22:00 hasn't changed, so I'll let you know more once our staff update us.

I know having power cuts as often as this must be very disruptive, and our staff are doing everything they can to get this resolved.\n\nThey are still testing our network in the area, and depending on the local infrastructure this can take some time. However, once they update us we'll know if our estimated time frame needs to change and why, and I'll let you know as soon as we hear.\n\nIn the meantime, if we can offer any support or advice, our team are always available to talk on 105.\n\nSent by David at 16:40.",

They will start running tests at our substation to see how the local network is operating.\n\nIt's quite common for power to be restored briefly and go off again; this is our engineers using testing equipment to energise different sections of our network - this helps to narrow down any possible issues.\n\nOur cabling network is often broken down by smaller sites, and our staff may also check these to test for any problems, and they may also walk the cabling route to see if there are any signs of malfunction that have appeared on the surface. Our time frame hasn't been adjusted, so for now I'll let you know more news as soon as our staff update us.\n\nSent by David at 16:28.",

Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

        "Comment": "We're sorry your power has gone off again.\n\nWe believe there may be an underlying issue causing the recent power cuts, but due to the nature of the electricity network, the heat created by a developing fault can cause a break in a cable to reseal itself. This can make it difficult to locate, so while our engineers are testing our equipment thoroughly to pinpoint the issue, this kind of problem may interrupt power multiple times before it's possible for us to fix.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nI'll keep you updated. Sent by David at 17:45",

They will then check our network equipment throughout the area to try and identify any problems, before trying to restore power.\n\nOur estimated time frame of 20:00-21:00 hasn't changed, but if this is not successful it's possible that a cable repair may be needed. As soon as our staff can safely update us, we'll give you the latest news. Sent by David at 17:39.",

Our engineers have completed their investigations.\n\nThere's going to be a lot of work required to repair the issue safely, so we have decided to use a temporary generator to provide power. To allow time for us to get the generator out to your area and connect it, we're now estimating we'll have power back on between 00:30 and 01:30.\n\nWe're sorry to change the time frame and will let you know when it arrives.",

We know a power cut can be difficult, especially in colder weather.\n\nMany properties have gas hobs, which can still be used in a power cut for cooking, or heating water for drinks and sterilisation of baby bottles. The spark to ignite the hob will not work however, so if you do use it please take extra care when using other ignition sources like matches or lighters. Even in daytime, the light in your house may be low in a power cut, so only do this if you are confident it can be done safely.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns, our team are always on hand to help.",

The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",

We didn't know this was going to happen, so time frames we provide throughout are estimated and are subject to change.\n\nOur estimated time to have power back on is currently between 22:00 and 23:00, but after we arrive and assess the situation this may change. The reason for this is there can sometimes be a more complex underlying issue found by our engineer's tests which may take longer, and if not we may get power back on sooner.\n\nAll of our texts are written and sent personally by our team, and we'll let you know once our staff arrive.",
