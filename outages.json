They will start running tests at our substation to see how the local network is operating.\n\nIt's quite common for power to be restored briefly and go off again; this is our engineers using testing equipment to energise different sections of our network - this helps to narrow down any possible issues.\n\nOur cabling network is often broken down by smaller sites, and our staff may also check these to test for any problems, and they may also walk the cabling route to see if there are any signs of malfunction that have appeared on the surface. Our time frame hasn't been adjusted, so for now I'll let you know more news as soon as our staff update us.\n\nSent by Theo at 10:14.",

However, this could change once our staff have assessed the local network.\n\nWe believe the power cuts you have been experiencing are caused by a fault with one of the cables. Developing faults can start very small, and so can be hard to detect but each power cut usually makes it easier to see, which means our specialist staff can detect it, and work on the repair to prevent further outages.\n\nI'll let you know once our teams arrive.",

        "Comment": "Sent by Talie at 09:44 - Our engineers are on their way. We believe the issue is an overhead cable fault that initially interrupted power to 536 properties.\n\nHowever, we have managed to divert power back to some properties, so 52 properties are still affected. Specialist engineers from our control room will continue to divert power remotely, so your power may come back on at any point. Sometimes we can't restore everyone this way, so we're also sending staff to check our equipment.\n\nWe're currently estimating power will be on between 12:30-13:30, but this may change depending on what our staff find.\n\nPower back on?

        "Comment": "What will happen next?\n\nThis outage affects multiple areas, so locations we mention may be further away than you expect. We're arranging staff to attend ASAP, but at the same time we try to restore power remotely by redirecting electricity. It's possible your power may go on and off as we try to get as many customers back on as we can.\n\nOnce available, our engineer will head to the local substation and after checking the network, they will attempt to restore more power from there. If unsuccessful, they will work to locate the issue and make repairs, which may take longer to get the lights on.\n\nOur staff work as quickly as they can, so you might not hear about everything we're doing but we'll always give you the clearest information we have.",

Our engineers have advised us that unfortunately there is going to be a delay in the power being switched off. This is due to access issues on site as a result of the wet ground conditions. We now estimate to switch off your power between approximately 09:45 and 10:15. Our reference number for this work is INCD-15810-I. We would like to apologise for any inconvenience this may cause you. If you have any questions or you have moved from the LU6 postcode area, then please give us a call on 105.",

We'll continue to monitor the situation closely however.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for these outages. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on. If your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

They may also walk our cabling route throughout the area to check for any visible problems, check smaller electrical sites in the area, or apply specialist equipment which may restore power temporarily to help them with their testing.\n\nWe know that our customers may be worried about the food in the fridge and freezer, so we want to try and help with advice. Food should keep for up to 4 hours in the fridge, and between 24-48 hours in the freezer if you avoid opening them.\n\nWe'll keep you updated on our engineers progress.",

Using an average timescale for this type of issue, we're looking to have you back on between 03:30 and 04:30, however we must stress that this time may change, depending on what our staff find.\n\nWe know that a power cut can be very disruptive; we understand this can greatly impact your daily activities and we want to support you however we can.

The issue was caused by an unexpected underground cable fault, which our engineers have been able to divert power around by isolating the faulty section from the main network.\n\nWe know that a power cut can be difficult, and I'm sorry for the length of the time you were without your electricity. Please rest assured that our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

Our team of cable jointers believe they have now identified the suspected section of faulted underground cabling using their specialist equipment.\n\nOur digging team are now starting excavations, these can take time due to the surface material and how much space will be needed for our engineers to assess the fault but at this stage we're still estimating to have the power back on between 02:30 and 03:30.\n\nWe're sorry to change our time frame, but we'll continue to keep you updated and our team are always here if you have any questions.",
