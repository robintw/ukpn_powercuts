This has identified trees that have grown close to 23 spans of electricity cables, which could damage the cables and affect your electricity supply. Our engineers need to safely cut the trees away from the cables. During this time, you will be connected to a generator to provide you with electricity whilst we carry out the works. To connect and disconnect the generator we will need to switch off your power temporarily. This work will reduce the risk of you having an unplanned power cut in the future as we appreciate that some customers have experienced an unplanned power cut in the last 6 months.

If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to speak to our team, but I'll let you know further news as it comes in from site. Sent by Kevin at 21:33.",

I know having power cuts as often as this must be very disruptive, and our staff are doing everything they can to get this resolved. Our estimated time frame to restore power is between 20:30-21:30.\n\nThey are still testing our network in the area, and depending on the local infrastructure this can take some time. However, once they update us we'll know if our estimated time frame needs to change and why, and I'll let you know as soon as we hear.\n\nIn the meantime, if we can offer any support or advice, our team are always available to talk on 105.\n\nSent by Decasta at 15:43.",

Please rest assured that our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",
