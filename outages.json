Our engineers have advised that unfortunately there is going to be a delay in restoring your power. This is due to the works taking slightly longer than first anticipated due to the previous delay this morning with the safety checks which has hindered the progression of the works. We now estimate to restore your power between approximately 16:30 and 17:30. Please note that this is an estimated time frame and that your power may come on sooner. Our reference number for this work is INCD-17281-I. We would like to apologise for any inconvenience this may cause you. If you have any questions or you have moved from the IP25 postcode area, then please give us a call on 105.",

The issue was caused by an unexpected fault with some of our network equipment, which our engineers have now replaced.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage. Please rest assured our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

We've just had a shift change, so Will, Luke, Aaron and Roland are now here to keep you updated with progress from our field teams.\n\nOur engineers are checking our substation equipment to ensure our network is healthy before they attempt to restore your power. They may also walk our cabling route throughout the area to check for any visible problems, check smaller electrical sites in the area, or apply specialist equipment which may restore power temporarily to help them with their testing.\n\nWe know it's frustrating being without power, but we wanted to assure you we're still here and as soon as we have some more information we'll update you again.",
