We have now restored power to all but one property. We're sorry for any disruption this unexpected power cut caused.\n\nIf your power isn't back on, we'd still like to keep you updated. If we aren't currently in contact with you by phone or in person at your property, please call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.\n\nWe know that being without power can be especially difficult, so we're sorry for the outage.

Please rest assured that our staff will continue to work around the clock to keep the lights on.\n\nIf your power isn't on or there's anything you'd like to talk to us about, call us on 08003163105 which is free from landlines and mobiles.",

Thanks for your patience today, I can see from our engineer's notes that your lights may have come on and gone back off several times since we've been made aware of the issue, and I'm sorry if this is causing you any worry.\n\nAs we've explained in previous messages, our staff work to divert power when a fault like this happens. Sometimes, these diversions can be unsuccessful, so we have to try routing power another way; this is why your lights are going off and on.\n\nIf at any point your power comes back on, you can always stop SMS updates here - https://UKPN.short.gy/STOP",
